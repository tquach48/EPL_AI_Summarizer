        "raw_text": "Villa had shown some promise between the interval and Konsa’s red card, though it was a largely underwhelming display from Unai Emery’s team, who did not have a single shot in the first half.\nComing away with a share of the points at least showed Villa’s resilience, while Newcastle may wonder what might have been had Isak been available.\nElanga could have got off to the ideal start in a Newcastle shirt when he raced through in the third minute, but Villa goalkeeper Marco Bizot – making his Premier League debut in the absence of the suspended Emiliano Martinez – made a fantastic save.\nGordon, filling in up top in place of Isak, headed over Harvey Barnes’ cross soon after, before the England international saw a deflected attempt palmed wide by Bizot.\nIn the second half, Boubacar Kamara headed straight at Nick Pope after being picked out brilliantly by John McGinn, yet Villa soon found themselves up against it.\nElanga threaded a superb ball in behind for Gordon to run on to – Konsa dragged the forward back and referee Craig Pawson showed the first red card of the 2025/26 Premier League season.\nMatty Cash made a superb block from a fierce Barnes volley, while Tino Livramento cushioned a volleyed cross just out of Gordon’s reach as Villa held firm.\nVilla won the corresponding fixture 4-1 last season, in what looked set to be a huge result in the race for Champions League qualification.\nBut it was not to be for Unai Emery's team, who missed out on a place at Europe’s top table on the final day of last season, and they have been unable to strengthen their squad as much as Emery would have liked over the off-season.\nAnd they looked sluggish from the off, sloppily turning over possession and offering little coming forward in the first half.\nThey came to life after the break; Kamara might have done better with his header from McGinn’s right-wing centre, while Ollie Watkins fired at Pope with his only real opening.\nJust as Villa were building up some pressure, though, it became a salvage job when Konsa got the wrong side of Gordon and reacted by hauling the attacker down.\nEmery will at least be pleased with the discipline and determination with which Villa defended from then on, while Bizot was in fine form when called upon, too. Substitute Donyell Malen offered some threat going the other way late on, but it would have very much been a smash-and-grab victory.\nHowever, Emery will want to see a much more well-rounded display from his team when they face Brentford next week.\nDespite the fact they have a UEFA Champions League campaign to look forward to, it has been something of a cruel summer for Newcastle.\nEddie Howe has had to answer plenty of questions over the future of star striker Isak, while he has seen reported targets slip through the club’s grasp, too.\nYet Newcastle demonstrated they still have plenty of quality even without Isak – their fluid front three of Barnes, Gordon and Elanga were extremely effective. However, the lack of an out-and-out striker was also evident.\nOn his competitive debut for Newcastle, Elanga could have broken the deadlock. That chance was followed up by a penalty appeal, as Barnes went down, but there was nothing doing for the officials.\nGordon, too, squandered a couple of chances, and it is not difficult to imagine these kinds of opportunities having been put away by Isak, if he had featured.\nJust what happens now with Isak remains to be seen, but in the meantime, Howe will hope for more incomings. Jacob Ramsey is reportedly set to join from Villa in the coming days, though his arrival will not resolve the striker situation.\nNewcastle’s first home game of the new campaign is against Liverpool on 25 August – an encounter that promises to be feisty.\nNewcastle have failed to win any of their last six Premier League games without Isak (D4 L2), failing to score in each of their last four, despite having 75 shots (9.4xG) across those six matches.\nVilla are unbeaten in their last 19 home matches in the Premier League (W11 D8), the Villans’ longest ever run on home soil in the competition.\nNewcastle are winless in their last four away Premier League games (D2 L2), their longest streak in the competition since a run of seven between October 2023-January 2024. They’ve also failed to score in four of their last eight away league games, as many occasions as in their previous 25.\nVilla failed to have a single shot in the first half of a Premier League game for the first time since March 2022 v Arsenal, ending a 123-game run of managing a shot in the opening half in the league.\nAston Villa report | Newcastle report",

He was cautioned for simulation following one challenge from Burn, but the forward was not deterred and drew a similar tackle to win Brentford's penalty.\nAndrews’ side have lost just once in their opening six home matches of the season, winning four of them, already making the Gtech an unwelcoming place for visiting teams.\nBrentford’s next match is a visit to Brighton & Hove Albion in two weeks’ time.\nNewcastle’s poor domestic form continued last week with a 3-1 loss to West Ham United, making it their worst start to a Premier League season under head coach Eddie Howe.\nHowever, they continue to thrive in Europe after beating Athletic Club 2-0 in midweek to register their third consecutive UEFA Champions League victory.\nThe Magpies’ lack of attacking threat was apparent once again in the opening stages of Sunday's game, but they still went in front as Barnes kept his composure to slam an effort home with his weaker foot after a clever dummy.\nBut despite taking the lead, Newcastle never looked close to adding to their advantage and their defence was eventually breached after they failed to properly clear their lines from a Brentford long throw.\nThe game-changing moment then came with 17 minutes to go, as Newcastle went a goal and a man down following Burn's mistimed challenge on Ouattara.\nThe Magpies are now winless in nine Premier League away games, and Barnes' goal represented their only effort on target throughout the match, with Nick Woltemade enduring another quiet outing, aside from his involvement in the build-up to that goal.\nHowe has plenty to consider throughout the international break, after which Newcastle host Manchester City.\nBrentford report | Newcastle report",

        "raw_text": "The hosts had the better chances after the break, with Bayindir producing a fine stop to deny Dango Ouattara’s goal-bound effort. Amorim’s men were handed the chance to level the game from the spot when Collins hauled Mbeumo back in the area.\nThe Brentford captain escaped a red card after a VAR check for the denial of a goal-scoring opportunity, with the on-pitch decision of a booking confirmed as it was deemed that Mbeumo was not in control of the ball.\nBut having missed a penalty in the capital at Fulham this season, Fernandes again failed to convert from 12 yards as Kelleher sprawled down to his left to parry the shot away.\nUnited continued to push for an equaliser, but were punished on the break when substitute Jensen cut inside from the left and sent a fizzing shot beyond Bayindir.\nKeith Andrews had been enduring a mixed start to life in Premier League management, with his Brentford team without a win in the top flight since Matchweek 2 against Aston Villa, but they got their campaign back on track here with a statement result.\nThe Brentford boss opted to restore club-record signing Ouattara to his forward line, and that injection of pace had the United back line stretched in the early exchanges, even though it was Thiago who struck the decisive blows with two fine finishes in quick succession.\nSesko’s goal meant there were some visible Brentford nerves, understandably given they had dropped eight points from winning positions this season, more than any other side in the division.\nBut the Bees kept things tight and were able to get themselves over the line here.\nThe game should have perhaps been out of sight when Van den Berg failed to test Bayindir on the stretch. Ouattara then squandered a glorious opportunity from inside the box, having been found by Schade after the lively German forward had got the better of Diogo Dalot down the left.\nThough hugely thankful for Kelleher’s penalty stop, this is a result Brentford will aim to build on, with their next Premier League match against Manchester City on home soil next Sunday.\nAmorim arrived at the Gtech Community Stadium in search of back-to-back Premier League victories for the first time in his United tenure, though the home of Brentford has not been a happy hunting ground of late, and things threatened to get ugly early on.\nThiago’s opening goal was far too simple from a Brentford perspective, with Henderson’s pass from deep catching Maguire as he attempted to step out as the last man, and it could have looked much worse for Amorim’s men when the Bees’ No 9 notched his brace.\nBayindir came to United’s aid after producing two stunning stops in quick succession to deny headers from Sepp van den Berg and Collins, though the visiting goalkeeper had perhaps been at fault for Thiago’s second after parrying Schade’s cross back into danger.\nSesko’s first goal for the Red Devils since his big-money move from RB Leipzig was one of the few positives for Amorim.\nUnited huffed and puffed, but were made to pay for their lack of efficiency in the final third.\nIndeed, from Cunha’s saved shot in the 52nd minute until the full-time whistle, Fernandes’ missed penalty represented their only shot on target.\nThere remains plenty for the United boss to ponder, with the scrutiny on United’s inconsistent form continuing.\nAmorim will aim to enter the October international break on a high when United welcome Sunderland to Old Trafford next Saturday.\nBrentford report | Man Utd report",

        "raw_text": "But Newcastle's pressure finally told in the 90th minute when Leno could only parry Osula's effort, giving Guimaraes a simple side-footed finish.\nFew would have expected Newcastle to enter this game 15th in the table, but Eddie Howe's side had struggled for rhythm in the season's early weeks, particularly in attack.\nIndeed, the Magpies had only scored seven goals in eight Premier League matches, though Tuesday's 3-0 win over Jose Mourinho's Benfica in the UEFA Champions League gave them fresh impetus.\nNewcastle looked a team inspired in the early stages, as they started at a relentless tempo. As well as hitting the post twice, they saw Guimaraes drag an effort wide and Anthony Gordon was inches from turning a wicked Murphy delivery home.\nThey should certainly have gone into half-time more than one goal to the good. Though Murphy punished one careless giveaway from Bassey, he then failed to convert from a similar position when the Nigerian played him onside just before the break.\nNewcastle somewhat lost their way in the opening stages of the second half, but in the final 30 minutes, they were clearly the more likely victors.\nGuimaraes and Elanga squandered good chances, but after Osula took advantage of another Bassey giveaway, the Brazilian was on hand to spark wild celebrations among the home fans.\nHaving put together back-to-back wins across all competitions, Newcastle will look to maintain their momentum against Tottenham Hotspur in the EFL Cup and West Ham United in the Premier League next week.\nLike their hosts, Fulham approached this match needing an upturn in the forward positions, with some toothless attacking contributing to their run of three straight defeats.\nFulham have benefitted from two own goals in the Premier League this season, and with none of their own players netting more than once, opposition players have been their best route to goal.\nTheir struggles in the final third continued in the first half of Saturday's game. Traore was their main outlet on the right flank, and though he enjoyed moments of joy when one-v-one with Burn, his end product was wide of the mark.\nBut Silva's introduction of Kevin, who took the place of the disappointing Emile Smith Rowe, breathed fresh life into the visitors' frontline. Moments after he squandered an opportunity to find Alex Iwobi unmarked at the far post, Kevin produced an inch-perfect cross for Jimenez, causing the scramble that led to Lukic's goal.\nHowever, Bassey's second big mistake cost Fulham a much-needed point, as his loose play in the centre circle allowed Osula to kickstart the move that culminated with Newcastle's winner.\nFulham have now lost four straight Premier League games for the first time since 2023 and desperately need a response. After visiting Wycombe Wanderers in the EFL Cup, they host Wolverhampton Wanderers next Saturday.",

        "raw_text": "And with the Sweden striker completing his British-record move to champions Liverpool on deadline day, Newcastle had to replace somebody who registered 29 goal contributions in the Premier League last season.\nNewcastle played their first three games of the season with only as a recognised striker, and their lack of attacking thrust certainly cost them in goalless draws with Aston Villa and Leeds United.\nHowever, in the last 48 hours of the window, Newcastle added Woltemade and . Though the latter has already sustained an injury blow, with no timeframe given for his return, Woltemade has hit the ground running.\nThe towering German showed some excellent touches on Saturday as he constantly involved himself in Newcastle's build-up play. He also put Premier League defenders on notice by ghosting behind Emmanuel Agbadou to score the deciding goal.\nWoltemade was only able to get through 65 minutes on his debut before he was replaced by Osula. But Newcastle's supporters have every reason to get excited about their attacking options, having also seen Anthony Elanga come off the bench against Wolves.\nWith Wissa and the suspended Anthony Gordon still to return, Howe will hope this victory kicks Newcastle's attack into life ahead of a busy period.\nThey open their UEFA Champions League campaign at home to Barcelona on Thursday, before visiting AFC Bournemouth in the Premier League three days later.\nAfter this defeat, Wolves have started a league campaign with four straight losses for the first time, in their 127th season in the Football League or Premier League.\nVitor Pereira's team have had issues at both ends of the pitch in recent weeks, and on Saturday, they were left to rue a series of missed chances in the first half.\nTheir direct approach from kick-off led to Gomes and Hwang going close inside the opening minute. Later, with the game still goalless, Fabian Schar made a heroic clearance to deny Tolu Arokodare a debut goal at the back post.\nGomes again went close with a header late in the first half, but Wolves' attacking momentum waned in the second half, as they sorely missed the imposing figure of injured striker Jorgen Strand Larsen.\nTo give themselves the best chance of winning matches and not dragging themselves into a relegation battle, Wolves must find a way of getting ahead in games. Next up for Pereira's men is a huge clash with Leeds at Molineux next Saturday.\nNewcastle report | Wolves report",

Liverpool face Eintracht Frankfurt on Wednesday, before heading to Brentford for their next league outing.\nIs this finally lift-off for Ruben Amorim at Man Utd?\nThe Red Devils managed an admirable 2-2 draw in the corresponding fixture last season, and also claimed a huge win at Manchester City, but those results ultimately proved false dawns. But this time, will it be different?\nMan Utd, for all their troubles, are into the top half and within touching distance of the top four. Even at this early stage, that will be a huge morale boost.\nIt could hardly have been a more ideal start for the visitors. Mbeumo deserves all the credit – he reacted sharply after that collision with two Liverpool players and showed a great burst of pace to get behind Van Dijk, and then great composure to finish past Giorgi Mamardashvili.\nIt could easily have been more for Man Utd, too, even if they did ride their luck at the other end. Fernandes was frustrated by the woodwork and Mason Mount shot at Mamardashvili before half-time.\nIt was more of a counter-attacking approach for Man Utd after the interval, with Matheus Cunha excellent as a link between defence and the forward line, while Fernandes worked tirelessly in midfield.\nGakpo’s goal did not take the wind out of Man Utd’s sails, either, and when the big moment came, Maguire was on hand to secure a win that might just prove Amorim’s team are on the right track. They host Brighton & Hove Albion next week.",

Another teasing run drew a foul from Harrison, with Anderson making no mistake from 12 yards.\nIt was just the momentum boost Dyche and his players needed heading into the international break, with reigning champions Liverpool up next, at Anfield on 22 November.\nIt is now four defeats in five Premier League games for Leeds, who remain just a point above the relegation zone heading into the final international break of 2025.\nThey had never lost a league game under Daniel Farke when scoring first, so the omens looked positive when Nmecha – restored to the starting line-up – broke the deadlock in clinical fashion.\nIt was also a welcome change in fortunes for Leeds, who had conceded the opening goal in all five of their Premier League away games this season.\nFarke urged his players to remain calm after scoring, but it was in vain as their joy did not last long, with Perri only able to divert Ndoye’s cross straight to Sangare for the equaliser.\nThe visitors generally struggled to threaten from that stage, and it was not until Farke’s own triple change in the 74th minute that they looked like scoring again. However, a loose challenge from Harrison ultimately allowed Anderson to take the contest out of their reach.\nHaving had the opportunity to move away from the bottom three, Leeds will certainly consider this a chance wasted – especially with their next four games after the international break coming against Aston Villa, Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool.\nForest report | Leeds report",

        "raw_text": "Milner was a key cog in City’s league triumphs in 2012 and 2014, before he moved on to be equally as impactful for Liverpool under Jurgen Klopp, and so it was fitting for the midfielder to open his Brighton account in the top flight – over two years after he joined them – against one of his former teams.\nHe celebrated by paying tribute to the late Diogo Jota, with Milner – now the second-oldest goalscorer in Premier League history – having taken the No 20 shirt this season in honour of his former Liverpool team-mate.\nHurzeler’s raft of changes proved a masterstroke, and a player 18 years Milner’s junior in Gruda capped off the turnaround by displaying the type of composure that Brighton lacked in their defeat at Everton last week.\nWith AFC Bournemouth coming up after the international break, Hurzeler will hope this superb comeback proves to be a jumping-off point for another strong season.\nCity lose control\nCity’s sluggish display against Tottenham Hotspur last time out will have served as a haunting flashback to parts of last season for Pep Guardiola, and with the Manchester derby coming up after the international break, City needed a positive response.\nFor much of this encounter, it looked as if they would get just that.\nCity had full control for the first hour, and the reintegration of Rodri, making his first Premier League start since he suffered that serious knee injury against Arsenal in September 2024, certainly helped.\nBut it will take a while for the 29-year-old to get back to his best level, and once Brighton found that new wave of energy after the changes, City lost their grip on the game.\nIt seemed as though Trafford would get them out of trouble when he acrobatically thwarted Van Hecke, but the vulnerability City displayed in 2024/25 was back on show again – they also fell to a 2-1 defeat in the corresponding fixture last season, having gone ahead through a Haaland goal.\nAfter starting the season so well with a 4-0 rout of Wolverhampton Wanderers, there will now be real pressure for City to stop the rot when Manchester United visit the Etihad Stadium on 14 September.\nBrighton report | Man City report",

The 39-year-old requires just 15 more to surpass Gareth Barry’s record.\nHowever, the hosts could not hold out and saw two points slip away in dramatic fashion.\nNext Sunday they will be Everton’s first Premier League visitors at their new home at Hill Dickinson Stadium.\nFulham and Muniz dig deep\nFulham came into their fourth consecutive campaign in the Premier League fresh from registering their record points tally in 2024/25.\nSilva’s side appeared to be in with a chance of qualifying for Europe last season, but they slipped out of contention towards the end of the season.\nFulham have made just one signing during the ongoing transfer window – bringing in goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte as back-up to Leno – and large periods of Saturday's game highlighted their need to strengthen if they are to kick on again.\nHaving only started one of their last eight league campaigns with a victory, it was always going to be difficult for Fulham against a Brighton side that had only lost twice at home in 2025.\nThe visitors generally struggled to impose themselves on the contest and appeared set for a bleak start. They had only recorded one shot on target as the game ticked into stoppage time.\nBut that all changed in the 96th minute, when Muniz sparked joyous scenes among the away supporters, who will hope not to have seen him in a Fulham shirt for the final time. The Brazilian celebrated by grabbing a fan's scarf and holding it aloft.\nThe point gives Silva’s men something to build on ahead of welcoming Manchester United to Craven Cottage next Sunday – by which time he will hope some new faces have arrived.\nClub reports\nBrighton report | Fulham report",
