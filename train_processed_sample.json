        "raw_text": "Viktor Gyokeres and Declan Rice were on target as Premier League leaders Arsenal coasted to a 2-0 victory over Burnley at Turf Moor on Saturday.\nGyokeres headed home a fourth league goal of the campaign from a typically brilliant Gunners set-piece to get Mikel Arteta's men up and running.\nRice was influential in that opener and doubled the visitors' lead 10 minutes before the break with a thumping header from a fine Arsenal breakaway.\nThe second half was a noticeably quieter affair, but the visitors never really looked like letting the lead slip after a dominant opening period despite Burnley attempting to up the pressure.\nArsenal have now won five straight league matches and have a seven-point cushion over AFC Bournemouth, while Burnley are 17th, four points above the drop zone.\nArteta’s side displayed their set-piece prowess in the 14th minute when Rice's deep corner was knocked back by Gabriel Magalhaes and nodded in on the goalline by Gyokeres.\nMartin Dubravka had to punch another Rice corner off the line and stood up well one-on-one to Bukayo Saka, who was then thwarted by the Burnley goalkeeper a second time before Leandro Trossard's follow-up was blocked on the line by Axel Tuanzebe.\nArsenal got their second in the 35th minute, though, when after Arsenal had cleared a Burnley long throw, Gyokeres played an outstanding cross-field pass to Trossard, who stood up a wonderful delivery for Rice to powerfully head in.\nGyokeres did not return for the second half, and the loss of that focal point meant Arsenal were not quite as effective in the final third after the break.\nTrossard tested Dubravka with a low drive, while Florentino headed over from Maxime Esteve's clever nod back in a rare Burnley attack.\nSubstitute Christian Norgaard was also denied by Dubravka before Marcus Edwards crashed a last-gasp free-kick against a post for Burnley.\nPrior to this game, 11 of Arsenal's 16 Premier League goals had arrived via set-pieces, so Parker will have been disappointed with the ease they made that 12 inside 15 minutes.\nWhile there was a beautiful simplicity to Arsenal's opening goal, there was a real majesty to their second that showcased Arteta's side are way more than just flat-track bullies.\nGyokeres had already combined twice to play in Saka, who on another day might have scored both, prior to delivering a stunning pass to Trossard – making his 100th Premier League appearance for Arsenal – to pick out Rice.\nWhat will please Arteta most is the influence of his key players. The Gunners paid big money to sign Gyokeres to make a difference in these sorts of games, and the only disappointment for the visitors would be his second-half absence.\nBut Trossard was a real tormentor on his landmark appearance, while Rice's growing standing as one of the best midfielders in the world was only enhanced with a typically all-action performance.\nVictory in Lancashire also marked a fourth straight league win without conceding – a feat they last achieved in 2014 when Arteta was a player – and they have the chance to continue that streak against Sunderland, a game that follows their midweek trip to Slavia Prague in the UEFA Champions League.\nBurnley have endured a couple of near misses against some of the Premier League's heavyweights this season, losing narrowly to both Manchester United and Liverpool earlier in the campaign.\nHowever, any hopes of frustrating title contenders Arsenal evaporated with the simplest of openers that belies the sort of defensive solidity Burnley have so often displayed under Scott Parker.\nFrom there, it felt like the Clarets were constantly fighting a losing battle. They were hassled, harried, and outmuscled by an Arsenal side they could scarcely lay a glove on.\nIndeed, they failed to register a single shot on goal during an opening period in which, truthfully, the main saving grace was that the scoreline was only 2-0, with Dubravka coming up big for his side.\nEdwards' free-kick at the very end of the game was ultimately the best they had to show for their efforts, but Parker will be far from deflated as he will be well aware that this is one of the toughest assignments his side will face.\nBack-to-back wins over Leeds United and Wolverhampton Wanderers prior to this fixture feel crucial in the context of the campaign, and Parker will be keen to get back to winning ways against struggling West Ham United next Saturday."

Brighton, meanwhile, are down in 12th.\nBournemouth’s strong start was rewarded in the 18th minute through Scott, who rifled an effort past Bart Verbruggen after good work from Semenyo on the edge of the box.\nThe Cherries continued to press on after taking the lead, with Evanilson looping a header just over the crossbar before Semenyo's strike whistled just wide of the right-hand post.\nBrighton improved as the half wore on and manufactured their best opportunity four minutes before the break, but Petrovic was equal to Minteh's near-post shot.\nFabian Hurzeler's side restored parity three minutes after the restart, with Minteh’s brilliant run from the right ending with a teasing cross for Mitoma to head home from a tight angle.\nThe Seagulls appeared to be gaining a foothold in the game, but their good work was undone when Lewis Dunk’s wayward pass led to Evanilson being caught by Van Hecke’s outstretched leg, and the in-form Semenyo making no mistake with the resulting penalty.\nA fabulous performance from Bournemouth earned them a 1-0 victory at Tottenham Hotspur just before the international break, and they picked up here from where they left off.\nScott continued his strong start to the campaign with a wonderful goal on the swivel, with the Cherries stretching their opponents in the opening exchanges, but Evanilson was unable to turn home Adrien Truffert’s delivery into the box.\nHowever, Bournemouth were stung by Mitoma’s goal so early into the second half, with James Hill guilty of leaving the winger free inside the area to level the match up, and that setback appeared to hinder the hosts as they struggled to ride the wave of Brighton’s momentum.\nDanny Welbeck’s close-range effort had Petrovic worried, but the nerves among the home supporters were calmed when Van Hecke clumsily brought down Evanilson.\nAhead of kick-off, Semenyo had never scored or assisted in his six Premier League appearances against Brighton, but he chalked both of those off after sending Verbruggen the wrong way, with the Bournemouth attacker full of confidence.\nBournemouth now have eight days to prepare for the visit of Newcastle United, who picked up their first win of the season against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday.\nBrighton went into the international break on a high after their comeback victory over Manchester City and will have headed into this encounter with confidence high within the ranks.\nHowever, their afternoon began on a sour note as Jack Hinshelwood was taken off before 10 minutes had passed, and this was compounded by Maxim De Cuyper also going off injured, after colliding with the advertising boards in the first half.\nSee the latest on injuries at every club\nBrighton struggled to deal with the high press forced upon them by the home side, with the likes of James Milner in midfield hurried when in possession during a first half in which they were distinctly second best.\nThey replied immediately after the break, with the dangerous Minteh whipping in a fine cross for Mitoma to apply the headed finish, highlighting the attacking edge that exists in the Brighton side even when they are not at their complete best.\nDespite their strong start to the second half, they were undone by a poor goal to give away by their standards, with Dunk's intercepted pass ultimately leading to Bournemouth being awarded a penalty.\nBrighton will look to get back to winning ways when they host Tottenham next Saturday.\nBrighton report | Bournemouth report"

The hosts' only two shots on target in the first half – from Tyler Adams and Semenyo – were separated by 32 minutes.\nAndoni Iraola's team were frustrated by Fulham's resolute five-man defence for much of the second half, too, with Calvin Bassey making one heroic last-ditch block to deny Alex Scott.\nWhile Bournemouth have generally impressed in the early season, they only scored one goal in their first two home games – a 1-0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers and a 0-0 draw with Newcastle United – and it looked as though they may fire another blank here.\nEnter Semenyo and Kluivert. The former now has six Premier League goals this season, with only Manchester City's Erling Haaland (eight) ahead of him in the Golden Boot race. The Dutchman's strike, meanwhile, was worthy of winning any match.\nSeveral teams could overtake Bournemouth in the table over the weekend, but the Cherries have a result to savour during the international break, ahead of visiting unbeaten Crystal Palace on 18 October.\nAfter back-to-back victories over Leeds and Brentford, Fulham's positive run was halted by a 3-1 defeat to Aston Villa last week, despite them taking an early lead through Raul Jimenez's header.\nBut eight minutes after his goal, Jimenez was withdrawn and appeared to be in major discomfort as he clutched at his hip. With Rodrigo Muniz already sidelined due to a hamstring issue, Adama Traore played the rest of the game as a makeshift striker.\nOn Friday, it was the turn of 18-year-old Josh King to lead the line, but Fulham struggled to make it stick up front throughout the first half.\nThe 14th-minute introduction of Cairney altered things, though, as he gave them a foothold in midfield after replacing Sasa Lukic, who became the latest Fulham player to suffer an injury.\nCairney's fellow substitute Chukwueze supplied the pass for Sessegnon's opener, but two moments of brilliance undid the Fulham backline.\nCastagne could not match Semenyo's pace and power for the Bournemouth equaliser, while Cairney was perhaps beaten slightly too easily in the build-up to Kluivert's wonder strike.\nMarco Silva will hope the international break allows some of his injured stars to recover, but Fulham must stew on back-to-back defeats during the hiatus, ahead of facing Arsenal at Craven Cottage in 15 days' time.\nBournemouth report | Fulham report"

        "raw_text": "Martin Zubimendi scored his first Premier League goals and the first ever brace of his top-flight club career in a dominant 3-0 win for Arsenal, as Ange Postecoglou's first game in charge of Nottingham Forest ended in defeat.\nZubimendi opened the scoring with a wonderful volley from the edge of the box in the 32nd minute, before Viktor Gyokeres was teed up by Eberechi Eze – who was making his first start for Arsenal – 47 seconds into the second half.\nChris Wood and Gyokeres struck the woodwork at either end, but Zubimendi made certain of the result with 11 minutes to play, heading in from Leandro Trossard's cross.\nBack to winning ways after their 1-0 defeat to Liverpool, Arsenal lead the table ahead of Saturday's other games, with nine points from four matches. Forest are five points back in 11th.\nHow the match unfolded\nArsenal dominated the first half, with a series of set-pieces causing Forest problems. The Gunners' first big chance came when a Martin Odegaard free-kick was nodded down to Mikel Merino, who was denied by the onrushing Matz Sels.\nAfter Odegaard limped off injured, Arsenal went ahead from another dead-ball. Wood only half-cleared Noni Madueke's corner, allowing Zubimendi to send a brilliant volley past Sels.\nForest's first shot did not arrive until Morgan Gibbs-White fired wide in first-half stoppage time, and they went 2-0 down almost immediately in the second half.\nEze stayed onside to beat Nicolo Savona and cross from the left, handing Gyokeres a simple finish.\nForest almost halved the arrears when Wood diverted Dan Ndoye's cross goalwards with his chest, only for the ball to hit the crossbar.\nGyokeres then rattled the near post with a ferocious effort at the other end, and Arsenal made the points safe when Zubimendi rose to meet an inviting delivery from substitute Trossard.\nArsenal new boys turn on the style\nArsenal needed a response after spending the international break stewing on a frustrating 1-0 defeat to title rivals Liverpool.\nBut having already lost Bukayo Saka and William Saliba to injury in the early weeks of 2025/26, they suffered a further blow when Odegaard was forced off after failing to recover from a heavy fall.\nHowever, Arsenal have invested heavily to bolster their attack, and their new boys led from the front.\nMadueke was electric on the right wing, tormenting makeshift left-back Morato early on and forcing Forest into some desperate defending with a series of inswinging corners, one of which resulted in Zubimendi's stunning first goal.\nOn the opposite flank, Eze was handed his first start after a brief cameo at Anfield, and he took advantage of some static Forest defending to assist Gyokeres, who drew level with Erling Haaland at the top of the early 2025/26 scoring charts with three goals.\nCristhian Mosquera also made his first start in the absence of Saliba and was a candidate for Player of the Match, making one brilliant goal-saving challenge on Callum Hudson-Odoi.\nWith their new players adapting quickly, Arsenal will hope to maintain their momentum in their opening UEFA Champions League fixture at Athletic Bilbao on Tuesday before hosting Manchester City next weekend in the league.\nPostecoglou left with plenty to ponder\nForest made headlines during the international break when Nuno departed, with a 3-0 defeat to West Ham United in Matchweek 3 proving to be his final game in charge.\nThough Postecoglou only had three days to prepare for this match, there was plenty of intrigue about how the UEFA Europa League winner would set Forest up.\nWith Ola Aina injured and loanee Oleksandr Zinchenko ineligible to face his parent club Arsenal, Postecoglou fielded Morato at left-back, and he struggled to contain Madueke.\nOne enterprising first-half dribble from Madueke would have resulted in a goal for Jurrien Timber if not for a heroic challenge from Murillo. However, the centre-back was hurt in that incident and had to be replaced shortly after Arsenal's first goal.\nHaving barely threatened, Forest might have been relieved to reach half-time 1-0 down, but the game was effectively beyond them when Savona was caught ball-watching for Arsenal's second goal less than a minute after the restart.\nForest enjoyed a few bright moments afterwards, with Wood going close and Deadline-Day addition Dilane Bakwa looking lively off the bench.\nPostecoglou will try to take the positives and get to work on the training ground, with an EFL Cup tie at Swansea City and a Premier League trip to Burnley to come next week.\nArsenal report | Nott'm Forest report"

But, Spurs needed a brilliant save from Vicario to deny Joel Piroe in second-half stoppage time.\nElland Road run comes to an end\nLeeds have been unbeaten at home in over a year, with a win over Coventry City in September 2024 marking the start of that run, having also beaten Everton and drawn with AFC Bournemouth and Newcastle United in the Premier League.\nBut, they fell short here despite making a strong start in a tale of squandered opportunities.\nLongstaff’s inviting free-kick in the seventh minute saw Vicario misjudge the flight of the ball, but Rodon could only head against the post, and they were made to pay soon after when Tel beat Darlow at his near post, with that moment allowing Spurs to settle.\nJoao Palhinha fired over after Ethan Ampadu failed to deal with a cross into the box, before Darlow was on hand to repel Destiny Udogie’s strike from a tight angle, but Leeds had their moments at the other end.\nCalvert-Lewin could have done better after Bentancur was dispossessed by Okafor, though the Switzerland international made no mistake when restoring parity with his effort in the 34th minute, despite an inflatable ball making its way on to the pitch, much to the annoyance of Vicario.\nLeeds continued to threaten in the second half as Calvert-Lewin’s shot on the swivel was blocked by the feet of Vicario before Anton Stach and Ao Tanaka fired wide, with Piroe’s late attempt brilliantly saved by the Spurs goalkeeper.\nThey will look to pick themselves up after the October international break, with a trip to Turf Moor to take on fellow promoted team Burnley in their next Premier League outing.\nSpurs weather late storm to get back to winning ways\nSpurs left it late to secure a 2-2 draw with Bodo/Glimt in the UEFA Champions League in midweek, and that display appeared to exert all of their energy in the opening exchanges, though their sluggish start went unpunished as Tel fired them into the lead.\nIt was Tel’s first Premier League goal since scoring against Wolverhampton Wanderers in April, repaying the faith shown in him by Thomas Frank, as Spurs found a way to score without an established focal point at the top end of the pitch, with Richarlison on the bench and Dominic Solanke out injured.\nThough they were susceptible to Leeds on the break, with Calvert-Lewin firing two warning shots either side of the break, Tel rattled the crossbar with a brilliant header in first-half stoppage time at the other end.\nSpurs could have entered the break with a more comfortable advantage after Kudus had blazed over following Udogie’s unchallenged run, but the winger signed from West Ham United more than made up for that miss by striking the winning goal.\nFrank introduced Kevin Danso and Pape Matar Sarr to shore things up at the back late on, but Leeds piled on the pressure and came close to an equaliser, only for Vicario to save Piroe’s close-range strike before Struijk's header was deflected wide late on.\nIt marks another excellent result in Frank’s early Spurs tenure, and he will be looking to build on that when they welcome Aston Villa to north London after the international break.\nLeeds report | Spurs report"

Ekitike produced a statement performance up front, having announced himself to English fans with a fine goal against Crystal Palace in the Community Shield last week.\nEkitike's clever movement caused Bournemouth problems early on as he continually dropped deep to evade the visiting centre-backs. He did exactly that for his goal, turning in a midfield position before gliding into the box and finishing with confidence.\nBut after the forward combined with Gakpo for the second goal, Liverpool began to look fragile defensively. Ibrahima Konate got nowhere near Brooks in the build-up to Semenyo's first goal, then backed off the Ghanaian as he motored forward for the equaliser.\nHowever, the Reds showed the heart of champions to come back and win a game they had thrown away, even after Slot's surprising withdrawals of Frimpong, Kerkez, Ekitike and Wirtz.\nChiesa’s strike spared the hosts’ blushes, while Salah's clinching goal made him the first player in Premier League history to net 10 goals on opening weekends..\nWith Slot's new-look attack purring, they will approach their trip to Newcastle United on 25 August with confidence.\nBournemouth may not have left Anfield with any points, but Andoni Iraola – who expressed frustration with their lack of transfer activity earlier this week – had plenty of positives to take away.\nSemenyo's brilliant performance was chief among them, with the winger taking the fight to his former team-mate Kerkez at every opportunity.\nFor his second goal, the 25-year-old began his run inside his own box and still had the presence of mind to place a fine finish beyond Alisson when he reached the other area.\nHowever, Iraola will have been less impressed by Bournemouth's defensive performance, after they lost four of last season's back five in Kepa Arrizabalaga, Kerkez, Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi.\nSenesi came in at centre-back and made a nervy start, with Liverpool feeling he had denied Ekitike a clear goalscoring opportunity via a handball when the ball bounced off his thigh and on to his arm in the 14th minute.\nIt was ruled that the action was not a clear handball and that the incident took place too far from the goal to be worthy of a red card, but Senesi was also involved in Ekitike's opener as his weak challenge resulted in the ball bouncing back into the 23-year-old's path for a simple one-on-one finish.\nBournemouth are reportedly close to signing Ben Doak from Liverpool, with Cherries winger Dango Ouattara set to join Brentford, but defensive reinforcements may be Iraola's main focus ahead of hosting Wolverhampton Wanderers in eight days' time.\nLiverpool report | Bournemouth report\nArne Slot: \"We started the second half really well, being 2-0 up but we were playing against a team that never gives up.\n\"You have to give credit to them but they faced a team that is very fit as well.\"\nAndoni Iraola: \"It has been a very good game of football.
