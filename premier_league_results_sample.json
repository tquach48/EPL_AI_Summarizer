        "report": "Danny Welbeck and Diego Gomez stole the show as Brighton & Hove Albion swept aside Leeds United 3-0 at the Amex Stadium.\nWelbeck had pounced for the first-half opener as the in-form striker scored for a sixth time in his last five league outings.\nGomez doubled Brighton's lead with a simple finish after 64 minutes, and added another to his account just six minutes later in a dominant home performance on Saturday.\nLeeds rarely looked like responding as they struggled for fluidity in the final third, only going close through late chances for substitutes Lukas Nmecha and Anton Stach.\nA drab performance leaves Daniel Farke's side 16th in the table, five points clear of the relegation zone, while Brighton climbed up to eighth after their convincing win.\nBrighton started fast and struck 11 minutes in when Yankuba Minteh excellently released Mats Wieffer, who squared across goal for Welbeck to convert from close range.\nWelbeck fizzed another attempt wide before Minteh's drive just evaded the bottom-right corner, as Leeds struggled to test Bart Verbruggen at the other end in a one-sided first half.\nIt was a similar story after half-time for a timid Leeds, who fell further behind when Minteh burst down the right and his deflected cross found Gomez to finish into an unguarded net.\nGomez made sure of victory for Brighton soon after as Georginio Rutter drove down the left-hand side before his cross bounced off Minteh and into the path of the Paraguayan to score.\nLucas Perri then expertly kept out another Gomez effort and a wicked Yasin Ayari strike, before Nmecha’s chance was denied by the right foot of Verbruggen, who parried from Stach's follow-up attempt.\nFabian Hurzeler decided to leave Welbeck on the bench for their EFL Cup defeat against Arsenal on Wednesday, and that rest seemed to pay dividends for the 34-year-old.\nAlong with his opener in this match, the forward has also scored match-winning braces against Chelsea and Newcastle United, as well as a brilliant free-kick at Old Trafford in a 4-2 defeat to Manchester United last time out.\nWelbeck's constant occupation of Leeds' central defenders allowed more space for his team-mates, with Carlos Baleba and Ayari both going close to scoring before the opener.\nMinteh, Rutter and Gomez all took advantage of that extra space too, with Brighton's two-goal hero left in acres of room for both of his finishes that came in simple fashion.\nThere were also positives for Hurzeler at the other end of the pitch as his side kept their first clean sheet in the league this season.\nWith a trip to rivals Crystal Palace next up for the Seagulls before the November international break, Hurzeler will be desperate for his team to build on this win.\nA raucous Leeds away support may have been expecting this result, as their side failed to score at the Amex for an eighth straight game in all competitions.\nIt continued a familiar, and more worrying, pattern for Leeds, who were unable to back up their 2-1 victory over West Ham United last time out.\nLeeds have now followed up their last seven Premier League wins with a draw and six defeats since they last won consecutive games in the top flight, back in November 2022.\nThe grey skies above the Amex were in keeping with Leeds’ lack of brightness in attack, with Dominic Calvert-Lewin again short of service and isolated up top.\nNoah Okafor and Brenden Aaronson struggled to make an impact, while Calvert-Lewin sliced wide an optimistic second-half attempt with his only real opening.\nFarke did try to push his side up the pitch in the second period, only for Perri's defence to be left exposed and punished in another disappointing away performance.\nLeeds must find a way to deliver away from Elland Road if they are to battle up the table, and they will have the chance to do just that when they travel to Nottingham Forest for a huge clash next time out.\nBrighton report | Leeds report"

        "report": "Viktor Gyokeres and Declan Rice were on target as Premier League leaders Arsenal coasted to a 2-0 victory over Burnley at Turf Moor on Saturday.\nGyokeres headed home a fourth league goal of the campaign from a typically brilliant Gunners set-piece to get Mikel Arteta's men up and running.\nRice was influential in that opener and doubled the visitors' lead 10 minutes before the break with a thumping header from a fine Arsenal breakaway.\nThe second half was a noticeably quieter affair, but the visitors never really looked like letting the lead slip after a dominant opening period despite Burnley attempting to up the pressure.\nArsenal have now won five straight league matches and have a seven-point cushion over AFC Bournemouth, while Burnley are 17th, four points above the drop zone.\nArteta’s side displayed their set-piece prowess in the 14th minute when Rice's deep corner was knocked back by Gabriel Magalhaes and nodded in on the goalline by Gyokeres.\nMartin Dubravka had to punch another Rice corner off the line and stood up well one-on-one to Bukayo Saka, who was then thwarted by the Burnley goalkeeper a second time before Leandro Trossard's follow-up was blocked on the line by Axel Tuanzebe.\nArsenal got their second in the 35th minute, though, when after Arsenal had cleared a Burnley long throw, Gyokeres played an outstanding cross-field pass to Trossard, who stood up a wonderful delivery for Rice to powerfully head in.\nGyokeres did not return for the second half, and the loss of that focal point meant Arsenal were not quite as effective in the final third after the break.\nTrossard tested Dubravka with a low drive, while Florentino headed over from Maxime Esteve's clever nod back in a rare Burnley attack.\nSubstitute Christian Norgaard was also denied by Dubravka before Marcus Edwards crashed a last-gasp free-kick against a post for Burnley.\nPrior to this game, 11 of Arsenal's 16 Premier League goals had arrived via set-pieces, so Parker will have been disappointed with the ease they made that 12 inside 15 minutes.\nWhile there was a beautiful simplicity to Arsenal's opening goal, there was a real majesty to their second that showcased Arteta's side are way more than just flat-track bullies.\nGyokeres had already combined twice to play in Saka, who on another day might have scored both, prior to delivering a stunning pass to Trossard – making his 100th Premier League appearance for Arsenal – to pick out Rice.\nWhat will please Arteta most is the influence of his key players. The Gunners paid big money to sign Gyokeres to make a difference in these sorts of games, and the only disappointment for the visitors would be his second-half absence.\nBut Trossard was a real tormentor on his landmark appearance, while Rice's growing standing as one of the best midfielders in the world was only enhanced with a typically all-action performance.\nVictory in Lancashire also marked a fourth straight league win without conceding – a feat they last achieved in 2014 when Arteta was a player – and they have the chance to continue that streak against Sunderland, a game that follows their midweek trip to Slavia Prague in the UEFA Champions League.\nBurnley have endured a couple of near misses against some of the Premier League's heavyweights this season, losing narrowly to both Manchester United and Liverpool earlier in the campaign.\nHowever, any hopes of frustrating title contenders Arsenal evaporated with the simplest of openers that belies the sort of defensive solidity Burnley have so often displayed under Scott Parker.\nFrom there, it felt like the Clarets were constantly fighting a losing battle. They were hassled, harried, and outmuscled by an Arsenal side they could scarcely lay a glove on.\nIndeed, they failed to register a single shot on goal during an opening period in which, truthfully, the main saving grace was that the scoreline was only 2-0, with Dubravka coming up big for his side.\nEdwards' free-kick at the very end of the game was ultimately the best they had to show for their efforts, but Parker will be far from deflated as he will be well aware that this is one of the toughest assignments his side will face.\nBack-to-back wins over Leeds United and Wolverhampton Wanderers prior to this fixture feel crucial in the context of the campaign, and Parker will be keen to get back to winning ways against struggling West Ham United next Saturday."

        "report": "AFC Bournemouth climbed to second in the Premier League table as a sensational late show from Antoine Semenyo and Justin Kluivert guided them to a 3-1 win over Fulham.\nIt looked like Fulham were going to battle to three important points in wet and windy conditions at Vitality Stadium when Ryan Sessegnon put them ahead in the 70th minute.\nBut that goal spurred Bournemouth's attackers into life, and Semenyo dragged them level when he slotted through Bernd Leno's legs at the end of a brilliant solo run eight minutes later.\nThe turnaround was complete within six further minutes as substitute Kluivert arrowed a spectacular effort into the top-left corner from 25 yards out, and there was still time for Semenyo to get his brace on the counter-attack deep into stoppage time.\nBournemouth's dramatic victory lifts them to 14 points from seven matches ahead of the international break, while Fulham stay 11th in the table on eight points.\nChances were at a premium throughout a hard-fought first half, with Bournemouth going closest when Leno blocked Semenyo's 42nd-minute drive.\nBournemouth were on top at the start of the second half, with Evanilson sending one chance wide and working Leno with another.\nDjordje Petrovic parried Harry Wilson's volley at the other end after a lovely set-up from Alex Iwobi, but from Fulham's next attack, Samuel Chukwueze's inch-perfect through-ball allowed Sessegnon to lift home.\nBournemouth looked to be running out of ideas, but Semenyo's fifth goal of the season got them level as he powered past Timothy Castagne to the byline before squeezing through Leno's legs from a tight angle.\nAnd Semenyo soon added an assist, though Bournemouth's second goal was all about Kluivert, who skipped past Tom Cairney before giving Leno no chance from distance.\nCairney went close from the edge of the box as Fulham threw players forward, but Bournemouth sealed it in the 96th minute as Ben Gannon-Doak raced clear to tee up Semenyo.\nBournemouth entered Friday's match on a high, with Eli Junior Kroupi's stoppage-time equaliser against Leeds United last week stretching their unbeaten run to five Premier League games.\nThey flew out of the traps here, penning Fulham back as crosses from Adrien Truffert and Semenyo forced panicked clearances.\nBut Bournemouth's momentum slowed, with the conditions proving an obstacle to their usually slick attacking play. The hosts' only two shots on target in the first half – from Tyler Adams and Semenyo – were separated by 32 minutes.\nAndoni Iraola's team were frustrated by Fulham's resolute five-man defence for much of the second half, too, with Calvin Bassey making one heroic last-ditch block to deny Alex Scott.\nWhile Bournemouth have generally impressed in the early season, they only scored one goal in their first two home games – a 1-0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers and a 0-0 draw with Newcastle United – and it looked as though they may fire another blank here.\nEnter Semenyo and Kluivert. The former now has six Premier League goals this season, with only Manchester City's Erling Haaland (eight) ahead of him in the Golden Boot race. The Dutchman's strike, meanwhile, was worthy of winning any match.\nSeveral teams could overtake Bournemouth in the table over the weekend, but the Cherries have a result to savour during the international break, ahead of visiting unbeaten Crystal Palace on 18 October.\nAfter back-to-back victories over Leeds and Brentford, Fulham's positive run was halted by a 3-1 defeat to Aston Villa last week, despite them taking an early lead through Raul Jimenez's header.\nBut eight minutes after his goal, Jimenez was withdrawn and appeared to be in major discomfort as he clutched at his hip. With Rodrigo Muniz already sidelined due to a hamstring issue, Adama Traore played the rest of the game as a makeshift striker.\nOn Friday, it was the turn of 18-year-old Josh King to lead the line, but Fulham struggled to make it stick up front throughout the first half.\nThe 14th-minute introduction of Cairney altered things, though, as he gave them a foothold in midfield after replacing Sasa Lukic, who became the latest Fulham player to suffer an injury.\nCairney's fellow substitute Chukwueze supplied the pass for Sessegnon's opener, but two moments of brilliance undid the Fulham backline.\nCastagne could not match Semenyo's pace and power for the Bournemouth equaliser, while Cairney was perhaps beaten slightly too easily in the build-up to Kluivert's wonder strike.\nMarco Silva will hope the international break allows some of his injured stars to recover, but Fulham must stew on back-to-back defeats during the hiatus, ahead of facing Arsenal at Craven Cottage in 15 days' time.\nBournemouth report | Fulham report"

        "report": "Tottenham Hotspur sealed a 2-1 win against Leeds United on Saturday, with Mohammed Kudus’s first goal for the club ending Daniel Farke’s side’s 23-game unbeaten league run at Elland Road.\nKudus picked out the bottom-right corner with a brilliant finish in the 57th minute, capping a fine individual display after assisting the game’s opening goal.\nSpurs had taken the lead in the 23rd minute through Mathys Tel’s deflected shot, but were pegged back before the break thanks to Noah Okafor’s effort from close range.\nThe deciding moment came just before the hour, with Kudus getting the better of Gabriel Gudmundsson on the right before flashing a fierce shot past Karl Darlow.\nThe result lifts Spurs to second in the league, one point behind leaders Liverpool, while Leeds remain 12th after their third defeat of the Premier League season.\nHow the match unfolded\nHaving seen former Spurs defender Joe Rodon head against a post early on, Leeds found themselves behind when Sean Longstaff was dispossessed by Rodrigo Bentancur, with the ball finding its way to Tel, who beat Darlow with the aid of a deflection from Pascal Struijk.\nHowever, the hosts hauled themselves level 11 minutes before half-time through Okafor, who tucked home from close range after Guglielmo Vicario had parried Brenden Aaronson’s initial shot into his path following neat build-up play from Dominic Calvert-Lewin.\nTel came close to doubling his and Spurs' tally in first-half stoppage time, but his brilliant header from Wilson Odobert’s cross into the box cannoned off the crossbar.\nAfter weathering a spell of pressure, Gudmundsson was unable to deal with Pedro Porro’s ball down the line, allowing Kudus to pick up the pieces and seal the win with a fine finish. But, Spurs needed a brilliant save from Vicario to deny Joel Piroe in second-half stoppage time.\nElland Road run comes to an end\nLeeds have been unbeaten at home in over a year, with a win over Coventry City in September 2024 marking the start of that run, having also beaten Everton and drawn with AFC Bournemouth and Newcastle United in the Premier League.\nBut, they fell short here despite making a strong start in a tale of squandered opportunities.\nLongstaff’s inviting free-kick in the seventh minute saw Vicario misjudge the flight of the ball, but Rodon could only head against the post, and they were made to pay soon after when Tel beat Darlow at his near post, with that moment allowing Spurs to settle.\nJoao Palhinha fired over after Ethan Ampadu failed to deal with a cross into the box, before Darlow was on hand to repel Destiny Udogie’s strike from a tight angle, but Leeds had their moments at the other end.\nCalvert-Lewin could have done better after Bentancur was dispossessed by Okafor, though the Switzerland international made no mistake when restoring parity with his effort in the 34th minute, despite an inflatable ball making its way on to the pitch, much to the annoyance of Vicario.\nLeeds continued to threaten in the second half as Calvert-Lewin’s shot on the swivel was blocked by the feet of Vicario before Anton Stach and Ao Tanaka fired wide, with Piroe’s late attempt brilliantly saved by the Spurs goalkeeper.\nThey will look to pick themselves up after the October international break, with a trip to Turf Moor to take on fellow promoted team Burnley in their next Premier League outing.\nSpurs weather late storm to get back to winning ways\nSpurs left it late to secure a 2-2 draw with Bodo/Glimt in the UEFA Champions League in midweek, and that display appeared to exert all of their energy in the opening exchanges, though their sluggish start went unpunished as Tel fired them into the lead.\nIt was Tel’s first Premier League goal since scoring against Wolverhampton Wanderers in April, repaying the faith shown in him by Thomas Frank, as Spurs found a way to score without an established focal point at the top end of the pitch, with Richarlison on the bench and Dominic Solanke out injured.\nThough they were susceptible to Leeds on the break, with Calvert-Lewin firing two warning shots either side of the break, Tel rattled the crossbar with a brilliant header in first-half stoppage time at the other end.\nSpurs could have entered the break with a more comfortable advantage after Kudus had blazed over following Udogie’s unchallenged run, but the winger signed from West Ham United more than made up for that miss by striking the winning goal.\nFrank introduced Kevin Danso and Pape Matar Sarr to shore things up at the back late on, but Leeds piled on the pressure and came close to an equaliser, only for Vicario to save Piroe’s close-range strike before Struijk's header was deflected wide late on.\nIt marks another excellent result in Frank’s early Spurs tenure, and he will be looking to build on that when they welcome Aston Villa to north London after the international break.\nLeeds report | Spurs report"

        "report": "Martin Zubimendi scored his first Premier League goals and the first ever brace of his top-flight club career in a dominant 3-0 win for Arsenal, as Ange Postecoglou's first game in charge of Nottingham Forest ended in defeat.\nZubimendi opened the scoring with a wonderful volley from the edge of the box in the 32nd minute, before Viktor Gyokeres was teed up by Eberechi Eze – who was making his first start for Arsenal – 47 seconds into the second half.\nChris Wood and Gyokeres struck the woodwork at either end, but Zubimendi made certain of the result with 11 minutes to play, heading in from Leandro Trossard's cross.\nBack to winning ways after their 1-0 defeat to Liverpool, Arsenal lead the table ahead of Saturday's other games, with nine points from four matches. Forest are five points back in 11th.\nHow the match unfolded\nArsenal dominated the first half, with a series of set-pieces causing Forest problems. The Gunners' first big chance came when a Martin Odegaard free-kick was nodded down to Mikel Merino, who was denied by the onrushing Matz Sels.\nAfter Odegaard limped off injured, Arsenal went ahead from another dead-ball. Wood only half-cleared Noni Madueke's corner, allowing Zubimendi to send a brilliant volley past Sels.\nForest's first shot did not arrive until Morgan Gibbs-White fired wide in first-half stoppage time, and they went 2-0 down almost immediately in the second half.\nEze stayed onside to beat Nicolo Savona and cross from the left, handing Gyokeres a simple finish.\nForest almost halved the arrears when Wood diverted Dan Ndoye's cross goalwards with his chest, only for the ball to hit the crossbar.\nGyokeres then rattled the near post with a ferocious effort at the other end, and Arsenal made the points safe when Zubimendi rose to meet an inviting delivery from substitute Trossard.\nArsenal new boys turn on the style\nArsenal needed a response after spending the international break stewing on a frustrating 1-0 defeat to title rivals Liverpool.\nBut having already lost Bukayo Saka and William Saliba to injury in the early weeks of 2025/26, they suffered a further blow when Odegaard was forced off after failing to recover from a heavy fall.\nHowever, Arsenal have invested heavily to bolster their attack, and their new boys led from the front.\nMadueke was electric on the right wing, tormenting makeshift left-back Morato early on and forcing Forest into some desperate defending with a series of inswinging corners, one of which resulted in Zubimendi's stunning first goal.\nOn the opposite flank, Eze was handed his first start after a brief cameo at Anfield, and he took advantage of some static Forest defending to assist Gyokeres, who drew level with Erling Haaland at the top of the early 2025/26 scoring charts with three goals.\nCristhian Mosquera also made his first start in the absence of Saliba and was a candidate for Player of the Match, making one brilliant goal-saving challenge on Callum Hudson-Odoi.\nWith their new players adapting quickly, Arsenal will hope to maintain their momentum in their opening UEFA Champions League fixture at Athletic Bilbao on Tuesday before hosting Manchester City next weekend in the league.\nPostecoglou left with plenty to ponder\nForest made headlines during the international break when Nuno departed, with a 3-0 defeat to West Ham United in Matchweek 3 proving to be his final game in charge.\nThough Postecoglou only had three days to prepare for this match, there was plenty of intrigue about how the UEFA Europa League winner would set Forest up.\nWith Ola Aina injured and loanee Oleksandr Zinchenko ineligible to face his parent club Arsenal, Postecoglou fielded Morato at left-back, and he struggled to contain Madueke.\nOne enterprising first-half dribble from Madueke would have resulted in a goal for Jurrien Timber if not for a heroic challenge from Murillo. However, the centre-back was hurt in that incident and had to be replaced shortly after Arsenal's first goal.\nHaving barely threatened, Forest might have been relieved to reach half-time 1-0 down, but the game was effectively beyond them when Savona was caught ball-watching for Arsenal's second goal less than a minute after the restart.\nForest enjoyed a few bright moments afterwards, with Wood going close and Deadline-Day addition Dilane Bakwa looking lively off the bench.\nPostecoglou will try to take the positives and get to work on the training ground, with an EFL Cup tie at Swansea City and a Premier League trip to Burnley to come next week.\nArsenal report | Nott'm Forest report"

        "report": "Antoine Semenyo’s sensational start to the Premier League season continued as his goal and assist helped AFC Bournemouth beat Brighton and Hove Albion 2-1 at Vitality Stadium.\nSemenyo had three goal contributions in three games to start the campaign, and he was involved again in the 18th minute when he teed up Alex Scott’s stunning left-footed opener.\nBut Brighton hit back three minutes into the second half through Kaoru Mitoma, who nodded Yankuba Minteh’s cross to the back post beyond Djordje Petrovic.\nHowever, the Cherries restored their lead just after the hour when Jan Paul van Hecke tripped Evanilson inside the box, allowing Semenyo to dispatch the resulting penalty and seal the win.\nBournemouth’s third consecutive Premier League win propelled them up to third in the early-season standings. Brighton, meanwhile, are down in 12th.\nBournemouth’s strong start was rewarded in the 18th minute through Scott, who rifled an effort past Bart Verbruggen after good work from Semenyo on the edge of the box.\nThe Cherries continued to press on after taking the lead, with Evanilson looping a header just over the crossbar before Semenyo's strike whistled just wide of the right-hand post.\nBrighton improved as the half wore on and manufactured their best opportunity four minutes before the break, but Petrovic was equal to Minteh's near-post shot.\nFabian Hurzeler's side restored parity three minutes after the restart, with Minteh’s brilliant run from the right ending with a teasing cross for Mitoma to head home from a tight angle.\nThe Seagulls appeared to be gaining a foothold in the game, but their good work was undone when Lewis Dunk’s wayward pass led to Evanilson being caught by Van Hecke’s outstretched leg, and the in-form Semenyo making no mistake with the resulting penalty.\nA fabulous performance from Bournemouth earned them a 1-0 victory at Tottenham Hotspur just before the international break, and they picked up here from where they left off.\nScott continued his strong start to the campaign with a wonderful goal on the swivel, with the Cherries stretching their opponents in the opening exchanges, but Evanilson was unable to turn home Adrien Truffert’s delivery into the box.\nHowever, Bournemouth were stung by Mitoma’s goal so early into the second half, with James Hill guilty of leaving the winger free inside the area to level the match up, and that setback appeared to hinder the hosts as they struggled to ride the wave of Brighton’s momentum.\nDanny Welbeck’s close-range effort had Petrovic worried, but the nerves among the home supporters were calmed when Van Hecke clumsily brought down Evanilson.\nAhead of kick-off, Semenyo had never scored or assisted in his six Premier League appearances against Brighton, but he chalked both of those off after sending Verbruggen the wrong way, with the Bournemouth attacker full of confidence.\nBournemouth now have eight days to prepare for the visit of Newcastle United, who picked up their first win of the season against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday.\nBrighton went into the international break on a high after their comeback victory over Manchester City and will have headed into this encounter with confidence high within the ranks.\nHowever, their afternoon began on a sour note as Jack Hinshelwood was taken off before 10 minutes had passed, and this was compounded by Maxim De Cuyper also going off injured, after colliding with the advertising boards in the first half.\nSee the latest on injuries at every club\nBrighton struggled to deal with the high press forced upon them by the home side, with the likes of James Milner in midfield hurried when in possession during a first half in which they were distinctly second best.\nThey replied immediately after the break, with the dangerous Minteh whipping in a fine cross for Mitoma to apply the headed finish, highlighting the attacking edge that exists in the Brighton side even when they are not at their complete best.\nDespite their strong start to the second half, they were undone by a poor goal to give away by their standards, with Dunk's intercepted pass ultimately leading to Bournemouth being awarded a penalty.\nBrighton will look to get back to winning ways when they host Tottenham next Saturday.\nBrighton report | Bournemouth report"

        "report": "Late goals from Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah gave champions Liverpool a dramatic 4-2 victory over AFC Bournemouth as the 2025/26 Premier League campaign got off to a thrilling start at Anfield.\nHugo Ekitike had a goal and an assist in an impressive Premier League debut to put Arne Slot's team in control, with the forward netting a first-half opener before teeing up Cody Gakpo shortly after the interval.\nBut Antoine Semenyo single-handedly dragged Bournemouth back into the contest, pulling one back in the 64th minute and then travelling from well inside his own half for a spectacular solo goal 14 minutes from time.\nLiverpool were not to be denied, however, as substitute Chiesa reacted quickest to volley home in the 88th minute, restoring the hosts’ lead with his first Premier League goal.\nSalah's breakaway effort then made certain of the result in stoppage time as Liverpool went top of the early standings, having paid an emotional tribute to their late forward Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva ahead of kick-off.\nBoth teams went close early on, with Salah’s stinging shot working goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic before Semenyo blazed over at the other end after escaping former Bournemouth team-mate Milos Kerkez.\nThe game was then paused in the 29th minute following a report of discriminatory abuse from the crowd directed towards Semenyo.\nMarcus Tavernier scuffed his effort when Bournemouth created another chance against the run of play in the 35th minute, and it proved costly when they fell behind two minutes later.\nEkitike took Alexis Mac Allister's pass in his stride, and after the ball rebounded back to him off Marcos Senesi, the Frenchman applied a cool side-footed finish.\nHe turned provider as Liverpool doubled their lead in the 49th minute, with Ekitike offloading to Gakpo, who skipped inside from the left to find the bottom-right corner.\nBournemouth, however, refused to lie down and after Semenyo tucked in David Brooks' precise cross to half the deficit, Anfield was stunned into silence when he travelled from midway inside his own half before drilling home the equaliser.\nBut the Cherries could not quite hold on for a point as Chiesa – who had replaced Florian Wirtz just six minutes earlier – adjusted his body and fired in a superb finish following a goalmouth scramble.\nAnd Liverpool were not done there as Salah raced forward on the counter to collect Wataru Endo’s long ball and send a right-footed finish across Petrovic four minutes into added time, capping a magnificent contest on the opening night.\nLiverpool became renowned for playing \"heavy metal football\" under Slot's predecessor Jurgen Klopp, but the Dutchman instilled more control in 2024/25 as his side cruised to the title.\nHowever, with the Reds signing exciting quartet Ekitike, Wirtz, Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong ahead of a possible move for Alexander Isak, some believed more end-to-end encounters were in store at Anfield in 2025/26.\nThat was certainly the case here. Ekitike produced a statement performance up front, having announced himself to English fans with a fine goal against Crystal Palace in the Community Shield last week.\nEkitike's clever movement caused Bournemouth problems early on as he continually dropped deep to evade the visiting centre-backs. He did exactly that for his goal, turning in a midfield position before gliding into the box and finishing with confidence.\nBut after the forward combined with Gakpo for the second goal, Liverpool began to look fragile defensively. Ibrahima Konate got nowhere near Brooks in the build-up to Semenyo's first goal, then backed off the Ghanaian as he motored forward for the equaliser.\nHowever, the Reds showed the heart of champions to come back and win a game they had thrown away, even after Slot's surprising withdrawals of Frimpong, Kerkez, Ekitike and Wirtz.\nChiesa’s strike spared the hosts’ blushes, while Salah's clinching goal made him the first player in Premier League history to net 10 goals on opening weekends..\nWith Slot's new-look attack purring, they will approach their trip to Newcastle United on 25 August with confidence.\nBournemouth may not have left Anfield with any points, but Andoni Iraola – who expressed frustration with their lack of transfer activity earlier this week – had plenty of positives to take away.\nSemenyo's brilliant performance was chief among them, with the winger taking the fight to his former team-mate Kerkez at every opportunity.\nFor his second goal, the 25-year-old began his run inside his own box and still had the presence of mind to place a fine finish beyond Alisson when he reached the other area.\nHowever, Iraola will have been less impressed by Bournemouth's defensive performance, after they lost four of last season's back five in Kepa Arrizabalaga, Kerkez, Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi.\nSenesi came in at centre-back and made a nervy start, with Liverpool feeling he had denied Ekitike a clear goalscoring opportunity via a handball when the ball bounced off his thigh and on to his arm in the 14th minute.\nIt was ruled that the action was not a clear handball and that the incident took place too far from the goal to be worthy of a red card, but Senesi was also involved in Ekitike's opener as his weak challenge resulted in the ball bouncing back into the 23-year-old's path for a simple one-on-one finish.\nBournemouth are reportedly close to signing Ben Doak from Liverpool, with Cherries winger Dango Ouattara set to join Brentford, but defensive reinforcements may be Iraola's main focus ahead of hosting Wolverhampton Wanderers in eight days' time.\nLiverpool report | Bournemouth report\nArne Slot: \"We started the second half really well, being 2-0 up but we were playing against a team that never gives up.\n\"You have to give credit to them but they faced a team that is very fit as well.\"\nAndoni Iraola: \"It has been a very good game of football. They win the points but we did a lot of good things too.\n\"Even at 1-0 at half time I was really happy. At the end you can't concede four goals but even with at 2-2 it looked like we had energy, but Liverpool when they need it they find the extra energy.\"\nReferee: Anthony Taylor. Assistants: Gary Beswick, Craig Taylor. Fourth official: Farai Hallam. VAR: Michael Oliver. Assistant VAR: Thomas Bramall."

        "report": "They twice came close on the counter, with Harry Wilson darting towards the edge of the penalty area and bending a shot narrowly wide, before Kevin saw a fierce low drive kept out by Sunderland goalkeeper Robin Roefs.\nKevin headed straight at Roefs from another opportunity soon afterwards while Josh King volleyed just off target later in the half, after Bertrand Traore's tame effort at the other end had been held by Bernd Leno.\nSunderland made a purposeful start to the second half, as Enzo Le Fee fired just wide just moments after kick-off.\nAt the other end, Ryan Sessegnon – on his 100th Premier League appearance – fizzed the ball into Wilson, who pulled a shot just the wrong side of the near post.\nSubstitute Emile Smith Rowe also fired just wide on the volley, but it was another player who came off the bench – Chukwueze – who delivered a wonderful in-swinging cross that was turned in by the outstretched leg of Jimenez.\nHome comforts proving crucial for Fulham\nThe late intervention from Jimenez provided Fulham with just the lift they needed after disappointing run of recent form.\nHowever, despite those struggles they have still been solid and consistent at Craven Cottage, with this win being their fourth triumph in their last five home league matches, and the only defeat in that run was a narrow loss against leaders Arsenal.\nFulham began the contest with plenty of intent. Wilson, fresh from scoring a memorable hat-trick for Wales against North Macedonia on Tuesday, and Kevin both looked lively and came close to breaking the deadlock during the first half.\nWilson was also a few inches away from opening the scoring after the break, but the game’s decisive goal came courtesy of only a second strike in the Premier League this season from Jimenez.\nIn the week Silva announced fellow striker Rodrigo Muniz will be out until the New Year with a hamstring injury, Mexico international Jimenez could not have picked a better moment to step up and deliver a crucial winner for Silva’s side.\nFulham have now claimed 13 of their 14 points this season at home. Given those exploits in front of their own fans, Silva may be slightly disappointed to be on the road against Tottenham Hotspur next Saturday.\nHowever, they will then welcome two members of the top four, Manchester City and Crystal Palace, to Craven Cottage in the first week of December.\nSunderland must regroup after late blow\nA positive result would have consolidated Sunderland’s position in the top four and, given the high standards they have set over recent weeks, this outing will have been disappointing for the travelling support.\nThe Black Cats, who were fresh from a stirring 2-2 draw with leaders Arsenal last time out, registered just two shots on target and lacked an attacking spark throughout the contest.\nThey were fortunate not to trail at half-time, but Le Bris’ words during the break appeared to be ringing in their ears when Le Fee drilled inches wide 10 seconds into the second half.\nThe visitors built on that momentum and started to look a little more positive going forward, but it did not take long for Fulham to recover control of proceedings, with Roefs regularly kept busy.\nSunderland came close to claiming what would have been a welcome away point, but were undone by Chukwueze’s delicious deep ball that was begging to be attacked, with Jimenez obliging to condemn the visitors to defeat.\nAfter suffering a first defeat in five league outings, Sunderland can still reflect on a magnificent first 12 matches back in the top flight and they will now regroup before looking to respond at home to AFC Bournemouth next Saturday, with the two teams locked together on 19 points.\nIt’s an exciting few weeks for Sunderland fans to look forward to, as that Bournemouth encounter comes before back-to-back away games against reigning champions Liverpool and Man City, with a home derby against fierce rivals Newcastle United to come after that.\nFulham report | Sunderland report"

        "report": "Brighton looked to hit back immediately after Thiago’s penalty, and generated a high volume of chances, with Minteh and Welbeck both firing off target, along with Rutter and Wieffer going close.\nBaleba’s rashness in Brighton’s box proved costly, but Hurzeler – who became the youngest coach to manage 50 Premier League matches – will be delighted with the persistence his team showed after the interval.\nWelbeck’s run and finish were matched by an equally fantastic delivery from Minteh, and Hinshelwood’s strike sparked wild celebrations.\nThat elation seemed set to turn to frustration when penalty expert Thiago stepped up late on, but Verbruggen made himself the hero. Next up is a tricky trip to Nottingham Forest, who stunned Liverpool in one of Saturday’s other matches.\nBrentford have now failed to win in any of their five Premier League visits to Brighton, even if they looked on course for something of a smash and grab before Welbeck got in behind their defence with just under 20 minutes of normal time remaining.\nKeith Andrews, in fairness, will feel his team were worthy of their lead heading in at half-time. Thiago continued his fine form by netting his seventh goal from his last seven league appearances, and the Bees almost doubled their advantage soon after when Ouattara‘s blocked shot teed up Yehor Yarmoliuk, whose volley skewed inches past Verbruggen’s post.\nFor all their bright play in the first half, Andrews’ side faltered defensively after the break as Brighton applied sustained pressure to turn the game around.\nYet given his form from the penalty spot, Thiago will have been supremely confident of rescuing a point. Ultimately, there was perhaps too much of a casual nature to how Brentford’s striker went about this pressure spot-kick.\nBrentford, and Thiago, will aim to bounce back next weekend when they host struggling Burnley.\nBrighton report | Brentford report"

Spurs got a major reprieve when Porro's blocked clearance did not result in a goal, but they would not be so lucky when Caicedo profited from the mix-up between Simons and Van de Ven.\nSpurs had a half-chance early in the second period as Rodrigo Bentancur almost pounced on a long Kevin Danso throw, but that brief moment of hope aside, the hosts were fortunate to avoid further damage on the counter-attack.\nThe defeat capped a disappointing day for Spurs, which started with Lucas Bergvall being substituted with a head injury in the seventh minute and ended with them eight points adrift of Arsenal.\nThey are at home again on Tuesday, against FC Copenhagen in the UEFA Champions League, before Manchester United come to town next weekend.\nDiscontent never seems to be too far away at Stamford Bridge, and a nervy 4-3 EFL Cup win over Wolverhampton Wanderers – in which the Blues were almost pegged back from 3-0 up – did little to atone for last weekend's 2-1 defeat at home to Sunderland.\nThere was some pressure on Enzo Maresca coming into Saturday's game, but he oversaw a strong first-half performance, which set Chelsea on their way to three points.\nThe Italian fielded captain Reece James as a central midfielder, and his physicality in the challenge and crisp passing through the thirds helped the Blues control the engine room.\nCaicedo was busy alongside him and played a key role in the game's telling moment, showing great awareness to dispossess Van de Ven, maintain his balance under pressure in the area, then pick out Joao Pedro.\nMaresca would have been braced for a Spurs onslaught after the interval, but that pressure never came as the Blues' back line stood up to a series of hopeful set-piece deliveries and Neto led several blistering counter-attacks.\nChelsea will now look to rest up ahead of a mammoth trip to Azerbaijan, to face Qarabag in the Champions League on Wednesday, before winless Wolverhampton Wanderers visit Stamford Bridge on Saturday.\nSpurs report | Chelsea report"

        "report": "Casemiro also flicked a header wide while, at the other end, Mateta spun to break in behind, only to drag his shot past the left post.\nYoro was then caught on the wrong side of Mateta again and clipped his heel inside the box. The Frenchman found the bottom-left corner from the spot, but it was ruled a double touch and a retake was ordered following a VAR review. However, he held his nerve to beat again, drilling into the opposite corner.\nBut United levelled nine minutes into the second half, with Zirkzee bringing down Bruno Fernandes' lofted free-kick before rifling beyond Henderson from a tight angle.\nUnited's turnaround was complete nine minutes later as Fernandes rolled another set-piece to Mount, who fired his shot through a weak Palace wall and in at the near post, and the hosts never truly threatened an equaliser.\nPalace approached this game off the back of a frustrating 2-1 defeat to Strasbourg in the UEFA Conference League, but they knew a victory would lift them, at least temporarily, into the top four of the Premier League.\nHowever, Oliver Glasner's side are yet to fully get into the swing of their Thursday-Sunday routine – all three of their Premier League defeats this season have come after midweek European games.\nPalace were comfortably the more dangerous team in an open first half. Their first big chance saw Mateta shoot into the side netting after barging down the left flank, while Adam Wharton volleyed straight at Lammens when left unmarked.\nWharton slipped a sublime pass into Mateta in the build-up to the penalty, which saw the striker become the Premier League's first beneficiary of an updated law adopted for 2025/26, with double touch spot-kicks now retaken if the original attempt is successful.\nBut Palace wilted after giving up their lead early in the second half, leaving supporters to question whether fatigue was a factor at the end of another busy week.\nIf Palace are to make good on their ambitions to qualify for Europe again, learning to manage that workload will be vital. They are in midweek action on the domestic front against struggling Burnley.\nA run of three straight Premier League victories in October landed Ruben Amorim led to renewed hope that his team had turned a corner.\nBut November had proven a more challenging month, with the Red Devils drawing with Nottingham Forest and Tottenham Hotspur then suffering a demoralising 1-0 defeat at home to Everton.\nIt looked like their downturn would continue as they ended an error-strewn first half behind. Yoro was twice caught out by the intelligent movement of Mateta, while Matthijs de Ligt was fortunate that Eddie Nketiah could not take advantage after his slip allowed the striker in.\nUnited were again without Matheus Cunha and Benjamin Sesko in attack, but Zirkzee and Mount grasped the opportunity to impress.\nZirkzee's goal was his first in the Premier League for 25 games, having netted twice against Everton on December 1, 2024. The Dutchman survived a nervy moment just after scoring, though, as Noussair Mazraoui's deflection ricocheted off him and almost flew into his own net.\nWhile Zirkzee was helped by some suspect positioning from Henderson for his strike, Mount's goal came when a glaring gap opened in Palace's wall, allowing the midfielder’s shot to soar through.\nAmorim will be delighted to see his team dig out a victory without two of their big-money signings, and Thursday's home game against West Ham United offers them a chance to build further momentum.\nCrystal Palace report | Man Utd report"

Martinez's wayward pass fell directly at the feet of Salah, and of the 250 goals the Egyptian has scored in a Liverpool shirt, few have come easier.\nSalah now has 276 Premier League goal involvements for Liverpool, with only Rooney (for Manchester United) matching that figure for a single club.\nThere was also a hint of fortune about Gravenberch's clincher, but the Dutchman deserved that moment after bringing more control to Slot's midfield, following three games out with an ankle injury.\nSlot will hope this result serves as a turning point ahead of a huge week for Liverpool, who host Real Madrid in the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday before visiting Manchester City in the Premier League next Sunday.\nSaturday's game was a battle between two teams on contrasting trajectories. While Liverpool had followed up five straight victories with four consecutive defeats, Villa had won four matches in a row after failing to triumph in any of their first five.\nUnai Emery's side carried the greater threat early on, with Ollie Watkins' clever movement into the channel creating space for Rogers to strike the woodwork.\nRather than sit deep and allow the out-of-form hosts to build confidence, Villa looked to play the game on their terms, pressing with intensity and allowing full-backs Cash and Lucas Digne to bomb forward.\nBut one moment of madness from Martinez swung the momentum Liverpool's way. His loose return pass was nowhere near Torres, the intended recipient, and Salah finished with ease.\nIn that moment, Emery might have been regretting Villa's reluctance to go direct, particularly with Slot admitting Liverpool had struggled to defend long balls all season.\nAfter failing to put up much of a fight in the second half, Villa's winning streak is at an end, and Emery will hope they can rediscover their momentum against Maccabi Tel Aviv in the UEFA Europa League, ahead of next Sunday's meeting with AFC Bournemouth.\nLiverpool report | Villa report"

        "report": "Gabriel's absence ensured there would be a baptism of fire for Bayer Leverkusen loanee Piero Hincapie, who made his first Premier League start in one of England's most fabled derby matches.\nBut Hincapie was hardly tested as Arsenal produced one of their most electric performances of the season, moving the ball at a relentless tempo and suffocating Spurs with their press.\nMerino and Trossard again showed their value in the absence of injured striker Viktor Gyokeres as they combined for the opener, but from then on, it was all about Eze.\nThe England international has previously admitted to rejecting interest from Spurs to rejoin his boyhood club, who released him at the age of 13.\nHis first taste of the North London derby could hardly have gone any better, as he became the first player to score a treble in the fixture in the Premier League.\nArsenal went into the international break disappointed following a late draw with Sunderland, but ahead of a big week in which they face Bayern Munich in the UEFA Champions League and Chelsea in the Premier League, their swagger is back.\nSpurs' start to life under Thomas Frank has been up-and-down, with the former Brentford boss facing criticism from some quarters for not adopting a more adventurous approach.\nHowever, few supporters were likely to care about Spurs' style if it yielded a rare north London derby victory.\nKevin Danso was one of five players introduced to their starting XI as Frank used three centre-backs, and the visitors took their time over every restart from the first whistle, prompting fury from the Arsenal fans.\nA wall of white shirts stood between Arsenal and Vicario's goal in the early stages, but with none of Richarlison, Wilson Odobert or Mohammed Kudus offering an outlet on the counter-attack, Spurs could not escape and ultimately saw their resistance broken.\nFrank's displeasure was made clear by the half-time withdrawal of Danso, with Xavi Simons his replacement as Spurs reverted to a back four, but conceding a third goal straight after the restart left their hopes of a comeback in tatters.\nRather than begin a fightback, Richarlison's goal only served to provoke Arsenal into further action, and Eze's hat-trick will sting his former suitors.\nSpurs face a daunting trip to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League before another London derby against Fulham next weekend, with Frank under pressure to oversee an improvement.\nArsenal report | Spurs report"

Still, there was little he could do to deny Unal making an instant impact by firing high into the roof of the goal from Marcos Senesi's expert through-ball.\nBournemouth continued to push, and Areola thwarted Evanilson from close range before Tavernier smashed the rebound over, while the visitors' goalkeeper also denied Amine Adli in a breathless finish.\nBournemouth's only defeat in their opening nine league matches was a frenetic opening-day loss at Liverpool, but they entered this contest on the back of consecutive losses.\nIraola will have been scratching his head at just quite how his side were two goals down at the break, given they dominated possession (73 per cent to 27), had more touches in the opposition box (14 to six), and had more shots (seven to two).\nIndeed, you could argue they were the architects of their own downfall. The wind was certainly swirling on the South Coast and Senesi completely lost the flight of the ball for West Ham's first, while Petrovic seemed to lose check of himself with his attempt at the save.\nBut Bournemouth were simply fantastic after half-time, and the equaliser had been coming by the time Tavernier drilled home his spot-kick.\nIt was a nice moment when Unal, who has had terrible luck with injuries, was the man to level up the game with his first Premier League goal since netting against the Hammers in December 2024.\nThe only real surprise was that Bournemouth did not go on to win the match, with Areola the chief reason for that. Still, a point puts an end to their back-to-back losses and Iraola's men can now prepare for next Saturday's lengthy trip to Sunderland.\nWilson was once a hero at the Vitality Stadium, scoring 67 goals in 187 appearances during a six-season stay before joining Newcastle United.\nCoincidentally, Wilson never managed to score against the Cherries during his time on Tyneside, but he was the scourge of his former employers on this occasion.\nBoth of Wilson's goals were the kind of finishes that have made him such a dangerous striker in the Premier League for so long, even if Senesi and Petrovic did not cover themselves in glory for his opener.\nBut with the wind and rain hammering in their faces for the second period, Nuno decided to remove his two-goal striker in favour of the more physical presence of Tomas Soucek in the 52nd minute.\nWhile the conditions suggest there was logic behind the thinking, Wilson had been by far the visitors' most sustained goal threat, and his removal coincided with a relentless second-half barrage from the hosts.\nOnce Bournemouth had fought back into the game with Tavernier's penalty, there was a sense of inevitability about the equaliser, and it was only thanks to the heroics of Areola that West Ham clung on for a point.\nNuno's men had previously won back-to-back games, and they will look to return to the win column when they host defending champions Liverpool at the London Stadium on 30 November.\nBournemouth report | West Ham report"

        "report": "A frenetic opening continued when Henderson brilliantly denied Gomez from 12 yards, and Brighton goalkeeper parried well from Sarr's edge-of-the-box effort.\nBrighton let Palace off the hook on the stroke of half-time when Minteh woefully side-footed wide after a rapid break from Gomez.\nPalace wasted a golden move 10 minutes after the restart, Sarr first tying his feet in knots after being slipped in by , before fired wide when the ball fell to him.\nRutter thought he had won a penalty after tumbling under the challenge of Jaydee Canvot, but, following a pitchside review by referee Tim Robinson, the decision was overturned and the Brighton forward was awarded a yellow card for simulation.\nKamada earned the ire of three Palace team-mates when lashing into the side-netting after showing good feet in the area, and substitute Yeremy Pino saw a low, stinging drive kept out by Verbruggen deep into second-half injury-time.\nPalace's 3-1 Europa League win over AZ on Thursday came at a cost with captain Guehi sustaining a foot injury that Oliver Glasner said could well see him sit out England duty over the international break.\nIt meant a first start for teenager Canvot, and the 19-year-old stood up well to the challenge of deputising in the absence of the Eagles' skipper.\nTogether with Chris Richards and Lacroix, he formed part of a Palace defence that were organised and switched on against a dynamic Brighton front line.\nThere was the heart-in-mouth moment when Robinson called for a spot-kick midway through the second half, though he made a great call to overturn that decision with Rutter clearly instigating the contact.\nGlasner has always had an uncanny knack of finding solutions whenever his squad has had to cope with a high-profile sale or injury, and so it proved again here, with Tyrick Mitchell also producing a fine performance in attack and defence.\nHad Palace been as composed in the opposition area as they were in their own, then they may have been celebrating a win on another occasion.\nGlasner's side will have the chance to get back into the win column after the break when they visit rock-bottom Wolverhampton Wanderers on November 22.\nGomez was a real livewire for the Seagulls, and on another day, he may have had a goal and an assist in the first half.\nThe Paraguay midfielder caught his early effort well after anticipating the flight of the ball and brilliantly bringing it down but was excellently denied by Henderson.\nIt was a much tougher chance than the one Gomez laid on a plate for Minteh at the end of the opening period, the winger dragging wide of the near post when he ought to have at the very least worked Henderson.\nAs the game neared a conclusion, Brighton were looking the more likely to take the lead against a Palace side looking a little leggy after their midweek European venture.\nBut Gomez and his team-mates just could not quite find a telling pass to unlock a resolute Palace defence and Fabian Hurzeler had to settle for a hard-fought point on his 100th competitive league game as a manager (49 in the Premier League).\nBrighton now have a near two-week gap due to the international break before welcoming Brentford to the Amex Stadium on November 22.\nCrystal Palace report | Brighton report"

        "report": "Defying their numerical disadvantage, though, Chelsea took the lead in the 48th minute, with Chalobah glancing a superb header home from Reece James’ excellent corner.\nMikel Arteta turned to Martin Odegaard and Noni Madueke for inspiration from the bench, but it was Saka who provided the spark Arsenal needed as he twisted Marc Cucurella one way and then the other before floating in a delivery for Merino to head in.\nSanchez denied Merino a winner in the closing stages, lunging low to his left to keep out a deflected shot from the edge of the box, with Chelsea's goalkeeper also doing well to beat substitute Viktor Gyokeres to a loose ball as the Blues claimed a deserved point.\nChelsea have now received six red cards in all competitions this season, and if they are to mount a serious title challenge, Enzo Maresca needs to ensure his team keep their heads.\nReferee Taylor set the tone early, handing out four yellow cards in the opening 27 minutes – although three of those were for Arsenal players.\nHowever, Caicedo – who was clearly fired up and had been snapping into challenges – got his tackle on Merino all wrong, and once the official went to the monitor, the writing was on the wall for Chelsea’s instrumental midfielder.\nThe Blues had been the better team before that, with Enzo Fernandez particularly effective as he bombed forward from midfield – the Argentine was denied by a superb Jurrien Timber challenge before seeing a stinging drive parried by David Raya.\nYet with Caicedo off, Fernandez had to play a more disciplined role in the second half, and even though Chalobah’s clever header put the hosts ahead, Arsenal’s man advantage gave them the impetus to get on the front foot.\nChelsea by no means caved despite the loss of a key player, though Maresca must now shuffle his midfield pack for Wednesday’s trip to Leeds United.\nCole Palmer, an unused substitute here after returning from injury, may well get minutes at Elland Road.\nGyokeres returned from injury as he came on as a second-half substitute, but it goes to show how highly Arteta values Merino that it was the Spain international who stayed on, with Eberechi Eze – the Gunners' north London derby hero last week – making way.\nMerino, by that point, had already nodded Arsenal level.\nSure, Saka's delightful skill and cross teed him up – the winger has now assisted four Premier League goals against Chelsea – but Merino had to be in the right place at the right time and keep his effort down.\nMerino has now scored 10 goals for Arsenal in the league, with seven of them coming via his head, and he has proved himself as an excellent alternative to Gyokeres when it comes to leading the Gunners’ attack, just as he did when Arteta was short of options last season.\nIt is testament to Chelsea, though, that from then on, the Gunners did not manage a single attempt on target until the 88th minute, when Sanchez got down to Merino's drive.\nArteta will be frustrated not to come away with the win, but he will no doubt know a point is a solid enough result ahead of Arsenal hosting Brentford on Wednesday.\nArsenal report | Chelsea report"

Another teasing run drew a foul from Harrison, with Anderson making no mistake from 12 yards.\nIt was just the momentum boost Dyche and his players needed heading into the international break, with reigning champions Liverpool up next, at Anfield on 22 November.\nIt is now four defeats in five Premier League games for Leeds, who remain just a point above the relegation zone heading into the final international break of 2025.\nThey had never lost a league game under Daniel Farke when scoring first, so the omens looked positive when Nmecha – restored to the starting line-up – broke the deadlock in clinical fashion.\nIt was also a welcome change in fortunes for Leeds, who had conceded the opening goal in all five of their Premier League away games this season.\nFarke urged his players to remain calm after scoring, but it was in vain as their joy did not last long, with Perri only able to divert Ndoye’s cross straight to Sangare for the equaliser.\nThe visitors generally struggled to threaten from that stage, and it was not until Farke’s own triple change in the 74th minute that they looked like scoring again. However, a loose challenge from Harrison ultimately allowed Anderson to take the contest out of their reach.\nHaving had the opportunity to move away from the bottom three, Leeds will certainly consider this a chance wasted – especially with their next four games after the international break coming against Aston Villa, Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool.\nForest report | Leeds report"

        "report": "However, Newcastle took the lead from their first real attack of the match, as Barnes smartly turned past two Brentford defenders inside the area before finishing through the legs of Caoimhin Kelleher.\nKeith Andrews' hosts applied more pressure on the Newcastle back line after the break and got their reward in the 56th minute, as Sven Botman could only direct a header from Kayode’s long throw into the path of Schade, who nodded into the net.\nIt got better for the Bees as Burn was given a second yellow card after challenging Ouattara – who had earlier been booked for simulation – inside the area, with Igor Thiago giving his side the lead from the spot with 12 minutes to play.\nThe Brazilian then added another on the break five minutes into stoppage time, taking advantage of Malick Thiaw's loose touch to make sure of the result.\nDespite a 3-0 loss away to Crystal Palace last week, Brentford had still acquired 13 points from their first 10 games for the fourth consecutive season, a particularly impressive feat after Andrews had stepped up to replace the popular Thomas Frank.\nThey largely controlled the beginning of the match, but struggled to convert that dominance with the ball into clear-cut opportunities.\nBrentford had barely been threatened defensively before they went behind to Barnes’ strike, which came after the Bees cheaply surrendered possession in a dangerous area.\nThey stepped things up further in the second half, though, and they got their rewards through their ninth goal from a long throw since the beginning of last season, along with a Thiago brace.\nOuattara was also a constant threat. He was cautioned for simulation following one challenge from Burn, but the forward was not deterred and drew a similar tackle to win Brentford's penalty.\nAndrews’ side have lost just once in their opening six home matches of the season, winning four of them, already making the Gtech an unwelcoming place for visiting teams.\nBrentford’s next match is a visit to Brighton & Hove Albion in two weeks’ time.\nNewcastle’s poor domestic form continued last week with a 3-1 loss to West Ham United, making it their worst start to a Premier League season under head coach Eddie Howe.\nHowever, they continue to thrive in Europe after beating Athletic Club 2-0 in midweek to register their third consecutive UEFA Champions League victory.\nThe Magpies’ lack of attacking threat was apparent once again in the opening stages of Sunday's game, but they still went in front as Barnes kept his composure to slam an effort home with his weaker foot after a clever dummy.\nBut despite taking the lead, Newcastle never looked close to adding to their advantage and their defence was eventually breached after they failed to properly clear their lines from a Brentford long throw.\nThe game-changing moment then came with 17 minutes to go, as Newcastle went a goal and a man down following Burn's mistimed challenge on Ouattara.\nThe Magpies are now winless in nine Premier League away games, and Barnes' goal represented their only effort on target throughout the match, with Nick Woltemade enduring another quiet outing, aside from his involvement in the build-up to that goal.\nHowe has plenty to consider throughout the international break, after which Newcastle host Manchester City.\nBrentford report | Newcastle report"

        "report": "A scuffed Cash effort represented Villa’s best opportunity in the first half, but Emery introduced Ian Maatsen and Malen at the break, with the Spaniard’s substitutions proving pivotal in turning the game around.\nMalen made an instant impact by teeing up Rogers to score, and Villa generally looked more lively with the Dutchman in attack as Ollie Watkins, who had been quiet for most of the contest, forced Perri into a smart stop soon afterwards.\nBarkley then won the free-kick that led to Rogers’ winner, and Villa were able to hold out to make it six wins from their last seven Premier League games, with a clash against rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers up next on 30 November.\nAfter seeing Nottingham Forest stun Premier League champions Liverpool on Saturday and West Ham United earn a point away to AFC Bournemouth, Leeds knew the importance of a result here, but they were unable to capitalise on their electric start.\nNmecha's early finish rewarded their intense approach, with Jayden Bogle proving an effective outlet down the right-hand side as his cross was flicked narrowly wide. However, Leeds suffered a blow when Anton Stach was withdrawn due to injury in the 23rd minute.\nAfter the two first-half chances for Aaronson at 1-0, Daniel Farke’s team failed to regularly threaten the Villa goal as the visitors' improved second-half display left them scrambling.\nCalvert-Lewin thought he had drawn Leeds level two minutes after Rogers' free-kick, but replays showed he had clearly touched the ball with his hand, and the hosts then had Struijk's late header impressively repelled by Martinez.\nLeeds will face a stern test when they attempt to return to winning ways next Saturday, away to Manchester City.\nLeeds report | Villa report"

Still, Burnley looked the more likely to threaten, and they did just that as Flemming brilliantly headed them in front.\nThat had not been helped by Paqueta’s 25th-minute booking, with the Brazilian now ruled out of West Ham’s next Premier League assignment away to AFC Bournemouth on 22 November after accumulating five yellow cards this season.\nBut that setback seemingly sprang West Ham into life, with Bowen almost levelling merely moments later, only to see his goalbound shot deflected just wide of Dubravka’s right-hand post by Cullen.\nWest Ham improved after the break and got the goals their performance merited through Soucek and Walker-Peters, though Nuno will be frustrated at allowing Burnley in with a shout late on.\nThe international break perhaps comes at the worst possible time for West Ham, who will be hoping to carry this momentum into that encounter with Bournemouth in two weeks’ time.\nBurnley’s possession-based philosophy under Scott Parker has brought them huge success upon their return to the Premier League, and their quality with the ball showed early in the match as they aimed to silence the already subdued West Ham crowd further.\nThough not troubling Areola, the visitors had their chances as Ugochukwu saw his shot deflected wide by Maximilian Kilman before the Frenchman’s teasing delivery narrowly evaded the sliding Flemming.\nFlemming was able to give Burnley a deserved lead, and their first-half display perhaps warranted more, but those missed chances came back to bite them as Wilson hit them with a sucker punch at the end of the first half, much to Parker’s frustration.\nFrom there, Burnley provided little goal threat at the other end as West Ham grew more confident, with Soucek and Walker-Peters’ strikes late on proving too much to come back from, despite Cullen’s late intervention offering the small chance of taking a point back to Turf Moor.\nBut the quality of the chances you get in the Premier League must be taken, and Burnley will go back to the drawing board ahead of their return to top-flight action in a tough test at home to Chelsea on 22 November.\nWest Ham report | Burnley report"

        "report": "Last week's 2-1 loss at Newcastle United was Fulham's fourth in a row in the Premier League, and they entered this contest teetering just three points above the relegation zone.\nClub-record signing Kevin was handed a maiden league start and his first contribution was an excellent block as he aided his side defensively, but the Brazilian had limited opportunities to affect the game going forward in the first half.\nFulham still managed an early goal, however, as Jimenez cut open the Wolves defence to find Sessegnon, who swept home for his second Premier League goal of the campaign.\nThere was more fluency in Fulham's offensive play during the second half, after they were aided by Agbadou's red card. Tete became more of a threat with his overlapping runs from right-back, while Kevin was also more direct on the left flank.\nWilson also contributed with a well-taken goal and Fulham created opportunities at will towards the end of the match, with the Welshman going close to getting his brace before substitute Samuel Chukwueze rattled the crossbar from close range.\nWith their confidence restored following a comprehensive win, Fulham travel to face Everton next weekend in their final match before the last international break of the year.\nMolineux was host to a mutinous atmosphere last week after Wolves conceded a late goal to lose 3-2 to Burnley, and the mood barely improved in midweek as they were eliminated from the League Cup, despite a battling performance against Chelsea.\nThe visitors did show some promise at the beginning of the match, with Jean-Ricner Bellegarde finding space in between the lines and working Bernd Leno in the Fulham net.\nHowever, their defensive frailties returned soon after as Bueno sloppily gifted the ball to Fulham, and that led to Wolves going behind early on for the fourth match in succession.\nThe game was virtually over as a contest once Agbadou was given his marching orders following a clumsy challenge on King, as Wolves made an unwanted piece of history.\nNo side in English top-flight history had failed to win their first 10 games in back-to-back campaigns until now, and Wolves already need a remarkable turnaround if they are to avoid relegation.\nIn the second half, Wolves' travelling fans amused themselves with chants recalling their heroes of the past, including Ruben Neves and Jimenez. In the present, things do not get much easier as they visit Chelsea next weekend."

        "report": "However, Luiz's replacement Yates played a key role in the equaliser, with his precise cross expertly converted by Gibbs-White for the Forest talisman’s first league goal of the season.\nThe hosts were then in dreamland when Savona opened his account for the club.\nIgor Jesus headed wide at the far post midway through the second half and Callum Hudson-Odoi also came close while Forest were in the lead.\nThose chances would ultimately prove costly with Amad drawing Man Utd level in superb fashion, and almost snatching victory at the death, but having lost their last four top-flight games without scoring coming into this clash with in-form Man Utd, there is plenty for Dyche to build on after naming Forest’s youngest starting XI of the season so far.\nAfter playing away to Sturm Graz in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday, Forest are back at home again next Sunday when they welcome Leeds United to the City Ground.\nIt already feels like a hugely important game for Dyche’s side, who will want to avoid being cut off from the teams above them before the November international break.\nDespite seeing their three-match winning streak in the Premier League end, Man Utd got themselves out of jail thanks to Amad’s brilliance.\nThe Red Devils appeared to have turned a corner in recent times, and had the chance to climb as high as second in the table with victory here.\nThey appeared on track to do so after naming an unchanged team and going ahead through Casemiro's well-placed header, but a slow start to the second half was costly, reminding their supporters that this team remains very much a work in progress.\nLammens was helpless to do anything about Gibbs-White’s header, after Amad had been outmuscled by the England international, but there will be more concern about the slow reactions from the United defence soon after when they were punished by Savona.\nTo their credit, though, the visitors kept plugging away. Fernandes was hugely unfortunate not to see his brilliant long-range strike nestle in the bottom corner, but Amad ensured they did not leave empty handed, with his first goal of the campaign proving to be a memorable one.\nThough Amad was then denied a winner with almost the last kick of the game, his late equaliser follows up some impressive recent Man Utd performances, giving Amorim a strong end to his first year in charge.\nIt is a sequence of decent results that United will hope to continue next Saturday when they travel to London for a huge clash with Tottenham Hotspur."

        "report": "Gibbs-White’s volley was their only noteworthy chance of the first half, and their defence was fortunate not to have been breached long before De Cuyper waltzed into the centre of the box unchallenged and applied a neat finish to break the deadlock.\nForest huffed and puffed after the interval, with Sangare inadvertently blocking a goalbound effort from Gibbs-White in the 61 minute, while Jesus’ eyes lit up when he was put through, only to be denied a maiden Premier League goal by Verbruggen’s eye-catching save.\nBut until Morato’s costly error in judgement, Forest had kept themselves in the game, and Dyche, renowned for his no-nonsense approach and organisation, will no doubt be infuriated by his defender’s lapse in concentration as he suffered his first home defeat since replacing Ange Postecoglou.\nDyche heads back to his former club Everton next weekend, but first, Forest will look to get back on track when they face lowly Wolverhampton Wanderers on Wednesday.\nIn February, Brighton suffered their heaviest league defeat in 67 years, when they were thrashed 7-0 in the corresponding fixture last season.\nBut Fabian Hurzeler’s team swiftly set about righting that wrong, setting the tone early with those chances for Minteh, Gomez and Rutter. They just lacked some composure when it counted, but De Cuyper – a natural left-back playing higher up on that flank – showed calmness in abundance when he coolly dispatched their opener.\nIn the second half, the Seagulls dug deep and defended resolutely, with Verbruggen making that key save to deny Jesus, before Jan Paul van Hecke produced a brilliant block to intercept Callum Hudson Odoi’s dangerous low cross.\nTzimas’ strike put the gloss on a fine all-round performance that was well worthy of three points, and Brighton head into a hectic December with the top four very much in their sights.\nThird-place Aston Villa visit the Amex Stadium on Wednesday, before Brighton host West Ham United.\nNott'm Forest report | Brighton report"

        "report": "Fabian Hurzeler decided to leave Welbeck on the bench for their EFL Cup defeat against Arsenal on Wednesday, and that rest seemed to pay dividends for the 34-year-old.\nAlong with his opener in this match, the forward has also scored match-winning braces against Chelsea and Newcastle United, as well as a brilliant free-kick at Old Trafford in a 4-2 defeat to Manchester United last time out.\nWelbeck's constant occupation of Leeds' central defenders allowed more space for his team-mates, with Carlos Baleba and Ayari both going close to scoring before the opener.\nMinteh, Rutter and Gomez all took advantage of that extra space too, with Brighton's two-goal hero left in acres of room for both of his finishes that came in simple fashion.\nThere were also positives for Hurzeler at the other end of the pitch as his side kept their first clean sheet in the league this season.\nWith a trip to rivals Crystal Palace next up for the Seagulls before the November international break, Hurzeler will be desperate for his team to build on this win.\nA raucous Leeds away support may have been expecting this result, as their side failed to score at the Amex for an eighth straight game in all competitions.\nIt continued a familiar, and more worrying, pattern for Leeds, who were unable to back up their 2-1 victory over West Ham United last time out.\nLeeds have now followed up their last seven Premier League wins with a draw and six defeats since they last won consecutive games in the top flight, back in November 2022.\nThe grey skies above the Amex were in keeping with Leeds’ lack of brightness in attack, with Dominic Calvert-Lewin again short of service and isolated up top.\nNoah Okafor and Brenden Aaronson struggled to make an impact, while Calvert-Lewin sliced wide an optimistic second-half attempt with his only real opening.\nFarke did try to push his side up the pitch in the second period, only for Perri's defence to be left exposed and punished in another disappointing away performance.\nLeeds must find a way to deliver away from Elland Road if they are to battle up the table, and they will have the chance to do just that when they travel to Nottingham Forest for a huge clash next time out.\nBrighton report | Leeds report"

        "report": "Some have suggested those numbers point to an overreliance on the Norwegian, but City's supporting cast were also excellent here.\nCherki marked his first Premier League start since August with two assists, with the first particularly impressive as his instinctive flick-on released Haaland without the striker needing to break stride.\nJeremy Doku was also a bright spark throughout, while Foden – making his 200th Premier League appearance – played a key role in O'Reilly's clincher, spinning away from Adams in midfield before finding his team-mate on the stretch.\nWith Haaland firing on all cylinders and City's creative players also coming into form, Guardiola will have high hopes ahead of two huge home games over the next seven days, against Borussia Dortmund in the UEFA Champions League and Liverpool in the league.\nBournemouth went into this game on the longest unbeaten run in the Premier League, having gone eight games without losing since their dramatic 4-2 defeat at Liverpool on the opening day.\nAnd Andoni Iraola's side made a confident start, with David Brooks wriggling into the box before his centre was swept in by Kroupi. However, the Frenchman should really have done better when looking along the line, as he wondered into an offside position.\nThe Cherries were not discouraged after falling behind, with Adams profiting when Donnarumma mistimed his punch under the slightest bit of pressure from Brooks. They also had further half-chances on the break, with their wingers lively.\nBut Iraola will not be impressed by the manner of City's goals. Every Bournemouth outfielder was in the hosts’ half when Cherki's header sent Haaland clear for the opener, and Adrien Truffert's poor attempt to play offside allowed the Norwegian in for his second.\nBournemouth made a bright start to the second half, but Kroupi saw one shot ripple the side netting and another sting the palms of Donnarumma, and they never truly threatened a comeback after O'Reilly's goal.\nIraola's team must now lick their wounds after seeing their unbeaten run come to an end, ahead of next week's visit to a possible rival for European qualification, Aston Villa.\nMan City report | Bournemouth report"

        "report": "Areola came up clutch with a big save to deny Isak midway through the first half, to continue a theme from last weekend's pulsating 2-2 draw with AFC Bournemouth, where the French goalkeeper made 10 saves.\nBut the issue is that for all their decent work defensively, they never laid a glove on their opponents at the other end – something that will hugely disappoint Nuno given the struggles Liverpool have endured defensively in recent weeks.\nWhen Isak, who now has six goals against West Ham, put the visitors ahead, the game had an almost inevitable feel about it, and the Hammers just could not muster a reply against the defending champions, who were already coasting by the time Gakpo made sure of things.\nWest Ham will hope they can show more attacking intent in Thursday's trip to face Manchester United, a task made harder by Paqueta's easily avoidable absence.\nThe Reds were beaten 3-0 by both Manchester City and Nottingham Forest in their last two league matches, and whether by design or just the nature of the game, they were much more solid defensively here.\nHowever, it did mean that Liverpool lost a little something going the other way, a situation perhaps more noticeable given talisman Mohamed Salah was dropped to the bench in the Premier League for the first time with Slot as head coach.\nBut the game may have been opened up a little earlier had Isak not been thwarted by the agile reflexes of Areola in the West Ham goal.\nAt that point, you may have forgiven Isak and Slot for fearing the worst, but the tension both men will have been feeling was lifted with a typically accomplished finish in what is his sixth top-flight appearance for the Reds.\nOnly time will tell whether this goal can be the spark to ignite his Liverpool career and indeed a turning point in the Reds' faltering campaign.\nBut it is certainly a starting point for Isak, and a foundation for Liverpool to perhaps rebuild from – a theory that will be put to the test when they host Sunderland on Wednesday.\nWest Ham report | Liverpool report"

Brobbey had other ideas.\nHe showed brilliant anticipation and improvisation to flick in the equaliser, though Ballard's later block – to deny Merino from just six yards out – was equally as important.\nSunderland's superb start to the season continues, and they can reflect upon another statement result throughout the international break, after which they travel to Fulham.\nWith Manchester City and Liverpool set to face off at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, Arsenal knew a victory on Wearside would pile huge pressure on their two main title rivals.\nBut they arrived in the North East depleted, fielding Merino as a makeshift striker, with Viktor Gyokeres, Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus all out. The Spaniard was in the wars early on, being caught by a stray elbow from Ballard, but he was able to continue after treatment.\nThey initially struggled to find any fluency in attack, but the momentum was with them after Saka's equaliser, with Zubimendi sending a left-footed flick narrowly wide before he struck the woodwork.\nTrossard was the Arsenal hero in another tight away game against Fulham last month, and when he picked out the top-left corner, it looked to be game, set and match.\nIndeed, Arsenal had won four straight games to nil ahead of this one, but their previously rock-solid defence was all at sea when Ballard flicked Trai Hume's cross towards Brobbey, who took his chance brilliantly.\nArsenal could now see their lead at the summit cut to as few as four points on Sunday, and their next game pits them against north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur after the international break.\nSunderland report | Arsenal report"

        "report": "However, Gueye’s absence through suspension was keenly felt here, as Newcastle carved through Everton’s midfield time and time again.\nIt started in the opening 30 seconds, with Keane inexplicably stepping forward and getting turned by Woltemade, who released Anthony Elanga.\nThe winger’s shot was saved, but the resulting corner saw Everton concede their earliest goal in a home league game since 2014.\nEverton appeared to be building up a head of steam after that blow, but their midfield was then exposed again in the build-up to Newcastle’s second, with a counter-attack leading to a corner, from which the Toffees never cleared their lines.\nIroegbunam’s miserable day was capped off when he gifted Newcastle their third, and it was no surprise to see David Moyes take him off at the interval.\nNot that Everton’s defence fared much better after the break, with Pickford, Keane, Jake O’Brien and Tarkowski all performing below their best. Dewsbury-Hall’s exquisite touch and finish for the Toffees’ goal will have done little to cheer Moyes.\nWith AFC Bournemouth coming up on Tuesday, Moyes suddenly has to deal with some troubling questions about the robustness of his defence.\nThe pre-match talk around Newcastle was whether Nick Pope would keep his place in goal after making a big mistake against Marseille in the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday, though that decision was seemingly taken out of Howe’s hands, with the former Burnley goalkeeper sustaining an injury in training on Friday.\nAaron Ramsdale, then, got the nod, but he was a bystander as Newcastle ran riot to get up and running on the road this term.\nThiaw’s opener hinted that Newcastle had watched how Tottenham Hotspur scored two of their three goals at Hill Dickinson Stadium last month, with Everton’s defence caught cold from a corner planted into the six-yard box.\nMiley was the deliverer of that set-piece, and he later got his reward for trying his luck in front of goal. Hall also saw a deflected effort loop off the crossbar before Woltemade showed his class on the stroke of half-time.\nRamsdale did not have much work to do until he had to claw James Garner’s corner off the line in the 53rd minute, with Alcaraz then rattling the woodwork on the rebound.\nNewcastle put the game to bed through another towering Thiaw header, after Woltemade had a shot blocked on the line by Tarkowski.\nDan Burn led an excellent defensive display, though Newcastle were caught napping somewhat when Barry saw his goal disallowed and Dewsbury-Hall scored, but those rare moments of complacency can be forgiven in such a dominant display.\nLike Everton, Newcastle play again on Tuesday, going up against Tottenham Hotspur.\nEverton report | Newcastle report"

        "report": "Enzo Maresca, marking his 50th Premier League game in charge of Chelsea, opted not to overexert Caicedo, with the midfielder given an extra bit of rest after his travel and exploits over the international break with Ecuador.\nThat decision seemed to have backfired somewhat early on, with Burnley finding plenty of space, but Andrey Santos swiftly asserted his authority on proceedings.\nThe Brazilian was not hugely influential in possession, but off the ball, he was brilliant, making a couple of vital interventions and consistently triggering Chelsea’s press.\nMaresca took another key player off at half-time, with Reece James making way for Benoit Badiashile, seemingly in a tactical change, and the Blues appeared to have more control as they switched to a back three.\nIt was by no means a superb display, and Maresca will have wanted the second goal to come much earlier than it did, nevertheless that kind of controlled performance will surely please the Chelsea head coach. They face a tough run of fixtures with Barcelona, in the UEFA Champions League, and Arsenal, coming up next week.\nBurnley blunted\nScott Parker will have been happy with Burnley’s start, with Anthony looking particularly bright.\nYet his team generated just two shots on target, and it is that lack of clinical edge that sees them at risk of dropping into the bottom three by the time the day is out.\nBurnley may well point to a potential handball not being given their way in the first half. Not long before the half-hour mark, Robert Sanchez passed it to Tosin Adarabioyo from a goal-kick.\nTosin seemed to misunderstand his goalkeeper and clearly handled the ball to stop it, but referee Peter Bankes decided that the ball was, in fact, dead, allowing the Chelsea centre-back to take the goal-kick.\nBut Burnley, ultimately, did not do enough to trouble Chelsea’s defence. Even as they built up a head of steam in the second half, the Clarets did not look particularly dangerous – Flemming’s wayward attempt was the best they managed.\nA trip to Brentford comes up next week, and after three straight defeats, it does seem that Burnley’s course for the season is destined to see them fight in a tussle at the bottom.\nClub reports\nBurnley report | Chelsea report"

The Toffees came within inches of a lead straight from kick-off as Garner drilled wide.\nIn an attempt to get Everton firing, Moyes opted to change strikers, with Barry replacing Beto.\nBarry played a key role in that opener, cleanly winning the ball off Sadiki.\nHowever, his first Everton goal remains elusive, though he will not have better chances to score than his close-range miscue.\nMoyes will not have felt comfortable at half-time with only a one-goal lead given their chances.\nA sluggish start to the second half, was not helped by star man Ndiaye, who has four goals this season, limping off near the hour.\nFollowing Barry’s miss in the 28th minute, Everton did not have another shot until Vitalii Mykolenko stung Roefs’ palms in the 85th minute.\nA home game against Fulham on Saturday now carries extra pressure, as Everton search for just their second win since August.\nClub reports\nSunderland report | Everton report"

When they did break through, however, Johnstone was equal to the challenge.\nBut that was not the case in the second half, with Wolves struggling to deal with Chelsea’s threat down both wings, with Garnacho twice setting up goals with left-sided crosses, while Joao Pedro’s came from Estevao’s low delivery on the right.\nJorgen Strand Larsen lashed a late chance into the stands with Wolves’ best chance, but their top-flight winless streak stretched to 15 games, with Crystal Palace up next on 22 November.\nChelsea report | Wolves report"

Rayan Cherki drew a big block from Van Dijk, while Phil Foden dropped into a deep-lying midfield role to dictate proceedings.\nThere was a hint of fortune about the way Ibrahima Konate lost the flight of the ball for Haaland's opener, but the move that led to the goal was vintage Guardiola, starting with some slick passing from Nico O'Reilly and Foden near their own corner flag.\nBut for all City's pretty build-up play, it was the direct running of Doku that got the home fans out of their seats. Liverpool had threatened to make things nervy before his pinpoint strike, which came after he bamboozled Konate with a quick touch out of his feet.\nCity – who are now four points behind Arsenal – have now won four straight games in all competitions, with a trip to out-of-form Newcastle United to come after the international break.\nAfter halting their four-game losing streak in the Premier League with last week's victory over Aston Villa, and then outclassing Real Madrid in the Champions League, Liverpool would have bounded into this game with plenty of confidence.\nBut that did not appear to be the case. Liverpool were penned back deep inside their own half from the first whistle, with the electric running of Doku giving Bradley a particularly tough time.\nLiverpool doubled up on Doku to no avail when he drew the foul for Haaland's missed penalty, while another driving run led to the Belgian testing Mamardashvili.\nAnd in the build-up to Nico's goal, they were slow to react to City taking a short corner, with Van Dijk throwing out a leg at the shot to wrongfoot his own goalkeeper.\nArne Slot was frustrated with the decision to disallow Van Dijk's header, but in truth, his team failed to apply any sustained pressure until they were 2-0 down and could have few complaints about the result.\nHugo Ekitike was isolated and did not attempt a shot before his 56th-minute withdrawal, and Slot did not risk Alexander Isak from the bench.\nThe Reds host Nottingham Forest in their first game after the international break, with their title defence under serious threat.\nMan City report | Liverpool report"

        "report": "Although they struggled in the defensive third, Wolves' attack gave some reason for optimism that Edwards may hope to build upon and ease ever-growing pressure from the Molineux support.\nJorgen Stand Larsen constantly occupied the Palace back line, winning the free-kick from which Joao Gomes almost scored, while the Norway striker also linked up well with Tolu Arokodare.\nArias provided a bright spark after coming on as well, and should have done better with his chance in the 75th minute when he stumbled over himself while shooting.\nAnother defeat, however, leaves plenty to think about for Edwards before their next league outing against Midlands rivals Aston Villa.\nPalace failed to win four consecutive games in all competitions last month, but Oliver Glasner’s side have now bounced back to go unbeaten in their last five.\nTheir resilience was key to breaking down Wolves as the visitors continued to pile on the pressure following every missed opportunity.\nGlasner was left in disbelief when Mateta’s first-half strike went wide of the post, which came shortly after they saw a VAR check for a potential penalty for a foul on Ismaila Sarr end with a free-kick awarded.\nSarr went close to scoring himself early in the second half, but the Palace winger fired over the bar with a first-time shot from Pino’s low cross.\nGlasner showed trust in his bench too, replacing Mateta with Eddie Nketiah in the 60th minute while the match was still goalless.\nNketiah almost found the back of the net in the final minutes of regular time, but his shot flashed wide of the target, with the result sealed.\nGlasner will need to continue relying on his whole squad, with a trip to Strasbourg in the UEFA Conference League on Thursday preceding their next league match at home to Manchester United.\nWolves report | Crystal Palace report"

        "report": "Forest's victory lifts Sean Dyche's side up to 16th while Liverpool drop into the bottom half of the table in 11th. The Reds could find themselves 11 points adrift of leaders Arsenal by the end of the weekend.\nHow the match unfolded\nLiverpool were denied by a heroic block from Elliot Anderson in the eighth minute, with the England international standing firm in front of Alexis Mac Allister's shot after neat footwork from Cody Gakpo.\nMilos Kerkez then diverted Mohamed Salah's cross over the crossbar before Forest struck against the run of play in the 33rd minute, with Murillo lashing home when Virgil van Dijk only half-cleared Anderson's set-piece.\nThe visitors thought they had a second moments later through Jesus, but after a VAR check, it was ruled the ball had bounced on to his arm before he drilled past Alisson.\nForest did have a two-goal cushion shortly into the second half. Neco Williams bundled past Mac Allister before cutting the ball back for Savona, who side-footed home.\nLiverpool were lacklustre in attack as Dominik Szoboszlai hit a tame attempt straight at Matz Sels, and Gibbs-White got Forest's clinching goal with a first-time finish after Alisson parried Omari Hutchinson's bending attempt, stunning the home fans into silence.\nBalance eludes Slot as Liverpool woes continue\nWhen Liverpool opened their title defence with five straight wins, few could have imagined they would emerge from the November international break eighth in the table.\nThe Reds started brightly enough here, with goalkeeper Alisson and Alexander Isak among five players brought in to start. They twice went close in the first 16 minutes, after neat footwork from Gakpo and Salah on either flank.\nBut Slot will be disappointed with the way Murillo was granted the time to take a touch from Van Dijk's half clearance before firing home, while Ibrahima Konate got a reprieve when he was outmuscled by Jesus for Forest's disallowed goal.\nSalah then saw an outside-of-the-foot effort pushed behind by Sels, with Mac Allister also heading into the Belgian's gloves. But Mac Allister was perhaps culpable for Savona's goal as Williams easily beat him on the left side of the area.\nSlot's first substitution, made in the 55th minute, told the story of Liverpool's desperation as Ekitike replaced Konate, but they never truly threatened a fightback before switching off from a quick free-kick for Forest's third goal.\nWith PSV Eindhoven next up in the UEFA Champions League on Wednesday and a trip to West Ham United to come four days later, Slot must get his star-studded squad to click quickly.\nDyche recapturing spirit of Nuno era\nLast September, a curling effort from Callum Hudson-Odoi handed Nuno Espirito Santo's Forest side a 1-0 victory at Anfield, a result that got everyone at the City Ground believing a push for European qualification was possible.\nSean Dyche will hope Saturday's victory has a similar galvanising effect. As was generally the case under Nuno, Forest were superbly organised here, with Murillo and Nikola Milenkovic dominating their penalty area.\nLiverpool got in behind Forest's full-backs on several occasions at 0-0, only for white shirts to pack the centre of the box and block everything the champions could throw at them.\nAnd although it was two defenders that got the first two goals in Murillo and Savona, a series of driving runs from Dan Ndoye and Gibbs-White allowed Forest to relieve Liverpool's pressure, and the latter deservedly capped a talismanic showing with a goal.\nNuno's Forest team combined defensive grit with the freedom for individuals to express themselves on the break, and after only a month at the helm, Dyche seems to have restored that blend.\nWith Ange Postecoglou's 39-day tenure in the rearview mirror, Forest are looking up ahead of a UEFA Europa League meeting with Malmo on Thursday, with Brighton & Hove Albion their next Premier League opponents.\nLiverpool report | Nottingham Forest report"

        "report": "Despite moments of pressure from Wolves at the other end, the hosts continued to play with the confidence that has characterised their season, with Youri Tielemans letting a trademark swerving effort fly from range to force Sam Johnstone into action.\nVilla persisted with their trusted tactic of shooting from range – one that has served them well this season, including when Rogers' dipping free-kick handed them victory at Leeds – but a deep, disciplined Wolves defence stood firm on the edge of the area.\nThat is, until Kamara blasted a brilliant effort beyond Johnstone's reach for Villa’s ninth goal from outside the box this season, a blow from which Wolves never recovered.\nNow up to third in the table, Emery will turn his focus to improving Villa’s away form as they travel to face Brighton & Hove Albion on Wednesday.\nAhead of kick-off, Emery rebuffed the notion that Villa were overwhelming favourites for victory, insisting anything could happen on derby day, and Wolves certainly gave some merit to that claim with a slew of chances in the first half.\nThe visitors were encouraged early on by Strand Larsen’s disallowed goal and continued to pose a serious threat down the right via the pacey Tchatchoua.\nThe Cameroon international made a series of surging runs on the overlap and often found Strand Larsen inside the box with precise deliveries, including for the first-time effort that forced Martinez into the first of two good saves on the stroke of half-time.\nIn just his second match since returning to Wolves, Edwards opted to persist with a familiar back-five formation, just as he had done for their loss to Crystal Palace last time out.\nBut unlike against Palace, the system looked to be working to good effect for Wolves as their backline consistently outnumbered Villa’s front four and limited them to half chances, until Kamara made it 1-0 with a bolt from the blue.\nFrom there, the path back was always steep, but Wolves can still take encouragement from a markedly improved performance as they look to end their Molineux misery against Nottingham Forest on Wednesday.\nVilla report | Wolves report"

They are known for being quick off the mark, but Sunderland were not prepared for the speed with which the visitors came out.\nAdams’ strike was one to remember, and the omens appeared promising, with Bournemouth having avoided defeat in their previous 10 league games when scoring first.\nHowever, Sunderland had clearly not read the script, and a sloppy challenge from Scott presented the Black Cats with a route back into the contest.\nThe Cherries were then undone by two set-pieces after the break, and their frustration boiled over in stoppage time. It culminated in Cook – on as a half-time substitute for Scott – receiving his marching orders.\nBournemouth will subsequently have to make do without him in their back-to-back home games against Everton and Chelsea, during which they will be desperate to put their recent struggles behind them.\nSunderland report | Bournemouth report"

The youngster immediately drew Pickford into a parry before teeing up Harry Wilson and Muniz for shots at goal.\nKing’s influence faded, though, with Muniz forced off with an apparent injury just 17 minutes after coming on. His replacement Adama Traore also tested Pickford, but Fulham’s defensive frailties came back to bite them when Keane beat his markers to score from Dewsbury-Hall’s delivery.\nFulham’s sole top-flight win since September came against lowly Wolverhampton Wanderers, and they may be casting a cautious eye over their shoulders as they prepare to face Sunderland after the international window.\nEverton report | Fulham report"

He looked primed to make it 3-0 when he side-stepped Vicario in the 26th minute, but Van de Ven galloped back.\nAt the other end, Calvin Bassey and Joachim Andersen – aside from one nervy clearance over his own crossbar – were generally excellent.\nSubstitutes Kevin and Emile Smith Rowe, as well as the tireless Jimenez, helped keep Spurs honest at the other end as Fulham saw out a memorable win. With Manchester City visiting Craven Cottage on Tuesday, Marco Silva's men will be eyeing another upset.\nSpurs report | Fulham report"

He miskicked when Pope was bearing down on him early on, before an instinctive effort from Nico O'Reilly's cutback struck the 'keeper, who knew little about the save.\nJeremy Doku was also heavily involved for City, and he appealed in vain for a penalty after seeing a shot strike Malick Thiaw's arm, while Foden also had a petition waved away after going down under Schar's challenge.\nCity started the second half brightly with Bernardo Silva curling wide, but two defensive lapses in seven minutes cost them. Their entire midfield was bypassed by Guimaraes' run for the first goal, and five blue shirts were beaten to the ball by Barnes for the second.\nHaving worked so hard to put pressure on Arsenal, they could now find themselves well adrift of the leaders before next Saturday's meeting with Leeds United. Before then, Man City host Bayer Leverkusen in the UEFA Champions League.\nNewcastle report | Man City report"

        "report": "The England midfielder was – alongside Jeremy Doku – at the heart of every City attack in the first half, and if not for Bogle and Perri, he could have had a hat-trick inside 25 minutes.\nIn truth, City should have gone into half-time more than two goals to the good, with O'Reilly wasting a glorious opening when the ball struck his shoulder and bounced into Perri's arms.\nIt looked like City would be made to rue those missed chances in the second half, as two defensive mistakes from Nunes and Gvardiol erased their lead. But Foden got his team out of a difficult spot.\nReceiving Rayan Cherki's pass while off-balance, he pirouetted away from Ethan Ampadu and Ao Tanaka, then worked half a yard of space to drill past Perri.\nThat moment could prove to be vital for City, though Guardiola will demand better defensive concentration away at Fulham on Tuesday.\nLeeds travelled to the Etihad having lost three straight games, with their two most recent defeats – against Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa – seeing them squander early advantages.\nThis time around, Daniel Farke's men showed impressive powers of recovery after falling behind but still came up empty-handed.\nLeeds enjoyed a positive spell immediately after Foden's opener as they pressed with intent high up the pitch, and only a brilliant challenge from Gvardiol prevented Nmecha from breaking clean through on goal.\nCity's second goal appeared to have killed the contest, but Farke's decision to switch from a 4-3-3 system to a 5-3-2 shape, featuring two traditional centre-forwards proved inspirational.\nThere was a slice of luck about the way the ball fell to Calvert-Lewin for Leeds' first goal, while they were also fortunate to see Pascal Struijk's sliced clearance drop just wide of his own post at 2-2.\nLeeds looked more likely to score the game's fifth goal as the home fans became worried late on, but Foden only needed a split second to stun the visitors, who have now failed to pick up a point since the end of October.\nThings do not get much easier for Leeds, either, as they welcome Chelsea and Liverpool to Elland Road in the next seven days."

        "report": "Gyokeres headed home a fourth league goal of the campaign from a typically brilliant Gunners set-piece to get Mikel Arteta's men up and running.\nRice was influential in that opener and doubled the visitors' lead 10 minutes before the break with a thumping header from a fine Arsenal breakaway.\nThe second half was a noticeably quieter affair, but the visitors never really looked like letting the lead slip after a dominant opening period despite Burnley attempting to up the pressure.\nArsenal have now won five straight league matches and have a seven-point cushion over AFC Bournemouth, while Burnley are 17th, four points above the drop zone.\nArteta’s side displayed their set-piece prowess in the 14th minute when Rice's deep corner was knocked back by Gabriel Magalhaes and nodded in on the goalline by Gyokeres.\nMartin Dubravka had to punch another Rice corner off the line and stood up well one-on-one to Bukayo Saka, who was then thwarted by the Burnley goalkeeper a second time before Leandro Trossard's follow-up was blocked on the line by Axel Tuanzebe.\nArsenal got their second in the 35th minute, though, when after Arsenal had cleared a Burnley long throw, Gyokeres played an outstanding cross-field pass to Trossard, who stood up a wonderful delivery for Rice to powerfully head in.\nGyokeres did not return for the second half, and the loss of that focal point meant Arsenal were not quite as effective in the final third after the break.\nTrossard tested Dubravka with a low drive, while Florentino headed over from Maxime Esteve's clever nod back in a rare Burnley attack.\nSubstitute Christian Norgaard was also denied by Dubravka before Marcus Edwards crashed a last-gasp free-kick against a post for Burnley.\nPrior to this game, 11 of Arsenal's 16 Premier League goals had arrived via set-pieces, so Parker will have been disappointed with the ease they made that 12 inside 15 minutes.\nWhile there was a beautiful simplicity to Arsenal's opening goal, there was a real majesty to their second that showcased Arteta's side are way more than just flat-track bullies.\nGyokeres had already combined twice to play in Saka, who on another day might have scored both, prior to delivering a stunning pass to Trossard – making his 100th Premier League appearance for Arsenal – to pick out Rice.\nWhat will please Arteta most is the influence of his key players. The Gunners paid big money to sign Gyokeres to make a difference in these sorts of games, and the only disappointment for the visitors would be his second-half absence.\nBut Trossard was a real tormentor on his landmark appearance, while Rice's growing standing as one of the best midfielders in the world was only enhanced with a typically all-action performance.\nVictory in Lancashire also marked a fourth straight league win without conceding – a feat they last achieved in 2014 when Arteta was a player – and they have the chance to continue that streak against Sunderland, a game that follows their midweek trip to Slavia Prague in the UEFA Champions League.\nBurnley have endured a couple of near misses against some of the Premier League's heavyweights this season, losing narrowly to both Manchester United and Liverpool earlier in the campaign.\nHowever, any hopes of frustrating title contenders Arsenal evaporated with the simplest of openers that belies the sort of defensive solidity Burnley have so often displayed under Scott Parker.\nFrom there, it felt like the Clarets were constantly fighting a losing battle. They were hassled, harried, and outmuscled by an Arsenal side they could scarcely lay a glove on.\nIndeed, they failed to register a single shot on goal during an opening period in which, truthfully, the main saving grace was that the scoreline was only 2-0, with Dubravka coming up big for his side.\nEdwards' free-kick at the very end of the game was ultimately the best they had to show for their efforts, but Parker will be far from deflated as he will be well aware that this is one of the toughest assignments his side will face.\nBack-to-back wins over Leeds United and Wolverhampton Wanderers prior to this fixture feel crucial in the context of the campaign, and Parker will be keen to get back to winning ways against struggling West Ham United next Saturday."

He was also involved in the build-up to Rice’s opener.\nSaka’s penalty brought up his 100th goal involvement in the competition. After Thierry Henry, he is just the second Arsenal player to score on his 200th Premier League appearance for the club.\nThe Gunners suffered during Saka’s absence at the start of the calendar year, he was missed again earlier this season, despite ’s bright displays.\nAnd with Madueke now sidelined with a knee injury, even more importance will be placed on Saka’s fitness, though there was some concern for Arteta when both Odegaard and Rice trudged off with issues.\nArsenal will hope those problems are minor ones, and Arteta will be keeping his fingers crossed that, should the duo feature for their countries over the coming weeks, they suffer no further damage, with the Gunners next in action against Fulham on October 18.\nIn just his second game in charge, a trip to Arsenal was never going to be easy for Nuno Espirito Santo.\nDespite seeing a half-chance squandered by Niclas Fullkrug within the opening minutes, it was a tame performance from the Hammers, who failed to build on Monday’s draw at Everton.\nThe visitors sat deep and looked to hit Arsenal on the counter, but they gained little to no joy with their game plan against an in-form attacking unit.\nAaron Wan-Bissaka was brought straight back into the starting line-up after recovering from injury, and he showed some promising link-up play with Jarrod Bowen.\nDiouf was not as effective in this match as he was against Everton, and his clumsy foul resulted in Arsenal’s penalty, while Lucas Paqueta also struggled to have much influence.\nWest Ham host Brentford in their first match after the break before a trip to Leeds United, and those two fixtures are likely to provide more insight for Nuno than a trip to a title contender.\nArsenal report | West Ham report"

Adam Wharton, a notable omission from Thomas Tuchel’s England squad for the upcoming internationals, once again played a key role in the Eagles’ build-up.\nLinking effortlessly with Daichi Kamada and Pino, he helped drive wave after wave of dangerous counter-attacks.\nWhile their first-half opener was much-deserved, Palace’s profligacy after the break was ultimately their undoing. Mateta, in particular, was guilty of some wasteful finishing.\nLapses in focus by Lacroix for the Everton penalty, and then by the entire defensive unit for Grealish’s winner, saw Palace’s status as the Premier League’s only unbeaten team in 2025/26 come to an end.\nPalace will aim to recover from their first competitive defeat since April when they face AFC Bournemouth on 18 October."

        "report": "Forest have now failed to win any of their opening seven matches under Ange Postecoglou in all competitions and head into the international break in 17th position.\nJoelinton ought to have done better with an early shot straight at Sels when rushing to meet Kieran Trippier's cross, and the Brazilian was denied by a fine save by Forest's goalkeeper with a back-post header shortly after.\nForest did a good job of keeping Newcastle quiet in a low-key first half, with the offset of that being their only shot on target was a tame 20-yard free-kick from Morgan Gibbs-White.\nMorato almost undid all that good work with an ugly touch in his own penalty area but recovered to make a fine block to prevent Woltemade's thumping volley.\nDan Burn had a couple of penalty shouts turned down before Guimaraes opened the scoring by bending a fine 25-yard effort past Sels.\nSels thwarted Tonali's exquisite dink and Woltemade rattled the woodwork but the German would not be denied, firing his penalty high into the top-left corner after Anderson's tired clip on Guimaraes.\nNewcastle's season has yet to fully kick into gear but a 4-0 UEFA Champions League win over Union Saint-Gilloise was at least a good antidote following the last-gasp heartbreak suffered against Arsenal last time out.\nEddie Howe's men found themselves frustrated by a more compact Forest defence in a first period that never really sparked into life.\nThere was a little more verve to the way Newcastle hassled and harried in the second half, though, and Guimaraes stole the ball high from Gibbs-White before applying a sublime finish after a neat interchange with Burn to set them on their way.\nWoltemade will wonder how he had not managed to score in open play, prior to Anderson's foul giving him a golden opportunity from the penalty spot, which he took with aplomb.\nThe former Stuttgart talisman has now scored in each of his first three home Premier League games, joining Les Ferdinand and Alan Shearer as the only Newcastle players to do so.\nHowe will hope for more of that form after the international break, as Newcastle look to build on their second Premier League win of the season when they visit Brighton & Hove Albion on 18 October.\nPostecoglou was subjected to discontent from the stands as Forest were beaten at home by Midtjylland in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday, with some reports suggesting his position was facing scrutiny even though that was only the sixth match of his tenure.\nOne issue in the matches preceding the Newcastle trip was Forest's defensive fragility.\nThey conceded 13 goals in six games, and a concerted effort to be more difficult to break down was evident here.\nWhile it did have the desired effect of quelling Newcastle's usually lively home crowd, it meant that Forest were unable to produce a great deal in attack – with an Expected Goals (xG) of just 0.07 at half-time telling its own story.\nA higher-octane Newcastle press in the second half then suffocated Forest, with Gibbs-White's insistence that he was felled by Guimaraes in the build-up to the opening goal only adding to the visitors' frustrations.\nHowever, the truth is it required some fine work from Sels to make sure the scoreline was not larger, with Malick Thiaw and Harvey Barnes joining Tonali in being denied by the busy Forest goalkeeper, prior to Woltemade sealing the points.\nChants were aimed at Postecoglou – who is the first Forest manager since 1925 to fail to win any of his opening seven matches – from home and away fans alike, and the pressure is mounting ahead of their next home encounter with Chelsea on 18 October.\nNewcastle report | Nottingham Forest report"

        "report": "Amorim has been forced to defend his use of a 3-4-3 formation on numerous occasions this season, and at Friday's pre-match press conference, he reiterated his belief that the Red Devils' primary problem was not his system.\nThough there was no change of formation on Saturday, Amorim did make five alterations to his starting XI, and a couple of those introduced had a major impact.\nMount made his first start since August and immediately repaid Amorim's faith with a sweeping finish past Roefs, which capped a flowing 18-pass move.\nDiallo was the standout United player in the first half, getting the hosts on the front foot with several driving runs upfield. The only blot on his display was a poor follow-up header after Fernandes' shot was pushed against the woodwork, which spun wide of a gaping goal.\nThe sight of Sesko getting a second poacher's goal in as many games will also encourage Amorim, while Lammens was composed on his debut, aside from one nervy incident in which he challenged Bertrand Traore, who was booked for simulation.\nBigger tests are still to come for United, though the result represents a step in the right direction.  Amorim will now have two weeks to work with his players on the training ground ahead of a huge clash with Liverpool on October 19.\nSunderland entered Saturday's game having made the best start to a Premier League campaign by any promoted club for 13 years, with last week's 1-0 win at Nottingham Forest putting them more than a quarter of the way to the magical 40-point mark.\nRegis Le Bris' side created the first opening after four minutes, but an offside flag against Simon Adingra spared Traore's blushes when he miskicked from six yards out.\nHowever, Sunderland let themselves down with some loose defending for Mount's opener, affording him far too much time to control Mbeumo's ball before picking his spot.\nLe Bris will also be disappointed by the manner of United's second goal, as Sunderland packed their own six-yard box, but still failed to defend a simple long throw.\nClearly unhappy with his team's defending, Le Bris sacrificed Adingra for Ballard in the 37th minute and switched to a three-man backline, and Sunderland immediately improved as Granit Xhaka's piledriver tested Lammens.\nBut in truth, the damage was already done by that point. Sunderland's extra centre-back gave them more security against United's counter-attacks, but United's own back three remained relatively comfortable.\nDespite a second defeat of the season, Sunderland can still reflect on a fine start to 2025/26 over the next two weeks, before they host Wolverhampton Wanderers.\nMan Utd report | Sunderland report"

By the latter stages of the first half, Kayode was under strict instruction from Andrews to not take any short throws.\nKayode's very first hurl into the area caught Liverpool's struggling backline out, as Ajer got ahead of Hugo Ekitike and Van Dijk to nod the ball on for Ouattara, who finished smartly.\nBut Brentford's performance was about more than dead-balls, with Damsgaard adding a touch of class in midfield – his assist for Schade was arguably one of the best of the campaign to date, as he split Liverpool's centre-backs with a pinpoint pass.\nBrentford could have won by a greater margin, too, with Ouattara and Thiago both missing presentable headed opportunities either side of Salah's goal.\nThe Bees have now won three of their last four league games. They visit Grimsby Town in the EFL Cup next.\nNot since a mid-season slump in the largely behind-closed-doors 2020/21 campaign had Liverpool lost four Premier League games in a row. Until now.\nArne Slot's team, who may have thought their fortunes had turned with a 5-1 thrashing of Eintracht Frankfurt in the UEFA Champions League, look a long way away from the winning machine that rolled to the title last season, and a poor defensive performance in the first half set the tone for this defeat.\nEarlier this week, Slot put Liverpool's recent troubles down to an inability to press teams that refused to play out from the back, saying: \"In the last four or five games, the ball wasn't on the ground, it was in the air.\"\nFew teams are as well-equipped to take the direct route to goal than Brentford, and after Ouattara’s opener, several more dead-ball deliveries were met with nervy Liverpool clearances.\nAn uncharacteristically sloppy performance from Van Dijk did not help matters, as he played Schade onside for Brentford's second goal, then flicked out a boot to catch Ouattara for the penalty.\nSlot has plenty of problems to solve ahead of a busy week, which sees Liverpool host Crystal Palace in the EFL Cup and Aston Villa in the Premier League.\nBrentford report | Liverpool report"

He was also involved in the build-up to Rice’s opener.\nSaka’s penalty brought up his 100th goal involvement in the competition. After Thierry Henry, he is just the second Arsenal player to score on his 200th Premier League appearance for the club.\nThe Gunners suffered during Saka’s absence at the start of the calendar year, he was missed again earlier this season, despite Noni Madueke’s bright displays.\nAnd with Madueke now sidelined with a knee injury, even more importance will be placed on Saka’s fitness, though there was some concern for Arteta when both Odegaard and Rice trudged off with issues.\nArsenal will hope those problems are minor ones, and Arteta will be keeping his fingers crossed that, should the duo feature for their countries over the coming weeks, they suffer no further damage, with the Gunners next in action against Fulham on October 18.\nIn just his second game in charge, a trip to Arsenal was never going to be easy for Nuno Espirito Santo.\nDespite seeing a half-chance squandered by Niclas Fullkrug within the opening minutes, it was a tame performance from the Hammers, who failed to build on Monday’s draw at Everton.\nThe visitors sat deep and looked to hit Arsenal on the counter, but they gained little to no joy with their game plan against an in-form attacking unit.\nAaron Wan-Bissaka was brought straight back into the starting line-up after recovering from injury, and he showed some promising link-up play with Jarrod Bowen.\nDiouf was not as effective in this match as he was against Everton, and his clumsy foul resulted in Arsenal’s penalty, while Lucas Paqueta also struggled to have much influence.\nWest Ham host Brentford in their first match after the break before a trip to Leeds United, and those two fixtures are likely to provide more insight for Nuno than a trip to a title contender.\nArsenal report | West Ham report"

        "report": "Ahead of kick-off, Sunderland head coach Regis Le Bris spoke highly of his side’s identity to earn points through defensive solidity, but it was their attacking intent that set the tone early on Saturday.\nIsidor’s disallowed goal stirred the Stadium of Light into life, and the optimism quickly paid off when Mukiele and Hume combined for the opener.\nMukiele started his run down the left, fed Hume centrally, and latched on to the perfectly weighted first-time return pass before slotting the ball into the net, with Johnstone only managing a faint touch on its way in.\nSunderland should have doubled their lead midway through the first half when Dan Ballard’s flick-on from a Mukiele throw found Hume, who should have done better with his close-range header.\nAfter the break, though, Wolves began to find their rhythm, forcing Le Bris’s men to lean on the very defensive resilience he had praised. And the hosts did just that, withstanding a spell of intense pressure courtesy of some standout proactive defending from Ballard and Omar Alderete.\nDespite the pressure, the hosts still carved out openings, with Isidor firing his early effort wide just past the hour mark before they got a slice of luck right at the end.\nLe Bris’s side will now prepare for a high-intensity trip to Stamford Bridge to face Chelsea, with the two teams level on points.\nWolves entered the October international break in need of a reset after back-to-back heartbreaks – having taken the lead against both Tottenham Hotspur and Brighton & Hove Albion, they failed to hold on for victory in draws.\nHowever, the break appears to have done little to change their fortunes. Unlike in previous outings, Vitor Pereira’s side did not strike first on Saturday, instead offering minimal resistance as Sunderland comfortably played their way through.\nTheir best moment of the first half came from Jhon Arias, whose deflected free-kick from a tight angle grazed the top of the net as Wolves failed to register a shot on target before the interval.\nPereira’s side responded strongly after the break, with Joao Gomes’ volley rolling wide after some positive build-up play. The Wolves midfielder followed that up with another off-target effort. For their part, Munetsi and Hugo Bueno continued to deliver dangerous crosses into the penalty area.\nDespite dominating possession across the second half, Pereira’s side had to wait until the 70th minute to register their first shot on target – one that ultimately did not count – as wasteful finishing continued to frustrate the Portuguese head coach.\nWolves will continue hoping for a change of fortunes as they next host another promoted side, Burnley, in what could be a pivotal clash at the bottom of the table.\nSunderland report | Wolves report"

        "report": "But Newcastle's pressure finally told in the 90th minute when Leno could only parry Osula's effort, giving Guimaraes a simple side-footed finish.\nFew would have expected Newcastle to enter this game 15th in the table, but Eddie Howe's side had struggled for rhythm in the season's early weeks, particularly in attack.\nIndeed, the Magpies had only scored seven goals in eight Premier League matches, though Tuesday's 3-0 win over Jose Mourinho's Benfica in the UEFA Champions League gave them fresh impetus.\nNewcastle looked a team inspired in the early stages, as they started at a relentless tempo. As well as hitting the post twice, they saw Guimaraes drag an effort wide and Anthony Gordon was inches from turning a wicked Murphy delivery home.\nThey should certainly have gone into half-time more than one goal to the good. Though Murphy punished one careless giveaway from Bassey, he then failed to convert from a similar position when the Nigerian played him onside just before the break.\nNewcastle somewhat lost their way in the opening stages of the second half, but in the final 30 minutes, they were clearly the more likely victors.\nGuimaraes and Elanga squandered good chances, but after Osula took advantage of another Bassey giveaway, the Brazilian was on hand to spark wild celebrations among the home fans.\nHaving put together back-to-back wins across all competitions, Newcastle will look to maintain their momentum against Tottenham Hotspur in the EFL Cup and West Ham United in the Premier League next week.\nLike their hosts, Fulham approached this match needing an upturn in the forward positions, with some toothless attacking contributing to their run of three straight defeats.\nFulham have benefitted from two own goals in the Premier League this season, and with none of their own players netting more than once, opposition players have been their best route to goal.\nTheir struggles in the final third continued in the first half of Saturday's game. Traore was their main outlet on the right flank, and though he enjoyed moments of joy when one-v-one with Burn, his end product was wide of the mark.\nBut Silva's introduction of Kevin, who took the place of the disappointing Emile Smith Rowe, breathed fresh life into the visitors' frontline. Moments after he squandered an opportunity to find Alex Iwobi unmarked at the far post, Kevin produced an inch-perfect cross for Jimenez, causing the scramble that led to Lukic's goal.\nHowever, Bassey's second big mistake cost Fulham a much-needed point, as his loose play in the centre circle allowed Osula to kickstart the move that culminated with Newcastle's winner.\nFulham have now lost four straight Premier League games for the first time since 2023 and desperately need a response. After visiting Wycombe Wanderers in the EFL Cup, they host Wolverhampton Wanderers next Saturday."

But, Spurs needed a brilliant save from Vicario to deny Joel Piroe in second-half stoppage time.\nElland Road run comes to an end\nLeeds have been unbeaten at home in over a year, with a win over Coventry City in September 2024 marking the start of that run, having also beaten Everton and drawn with AFC Bournemouth and Newcastle United in the Premier League.\nBut, they fell short here despite making a strong start in a tale of squandered opportunities.\nLongstaff’s inviting free-kick in the seventh minute saw Vicario misjudge the flight of the ball, but Rodon could only head against the post, and they were made to pay soon after when Tel beat Darlow at his near post, with that moment allowing Spurs to settle.\nJoao Palhinha fired over after Ethan Ampadu failed to deal with a cross into the box, before Darlow was on hand to repel Destiny Udogie’s strike from a tight angle, but Leeds had their moments at the other end.\nCalvert-Lewin could have done better after Bentancur was dispossessed by Okafor, though the Switzerland international made no mistake when restoring parity with his effort in the 34th minute, despite an inflatable ball making its way on to the pitch, much to the annoyance of Vicario.\nLeeds continued to threaten in the second half as Calvert-Lewin’s shot on the swivel was blocked by the feet of Vicario before Anton Stach and Ao Tanaka fired wide, with Piroe’s late attempt brilliantly saved by the Spurs goalkeeper.\nThey will look to pick themselves up after the October international break, with a trip to Turf Moor to take on fellow promoted team Burnley in their next Premier League outing.\nSpurs weather late storm to get back to winning ways\nSpurs left it late to secure a 2-2 draw with Bodo/Glimt in the UEFA Champions League in midweek, and that display appeared to exert all of their energy in the opening exchanges, though their sluggish start went unpunished as Tel fired them into the lead.\nIt was Tel’s first Premier League goal since scoring against Wolverhampton Wanderers in April, repaying the faith shown in him by Thomas Frank, as Spurs found a way to score without an established focal point at the top end of the pitch, with Richarlison on the bench and Dominic Solanke out injured.\nThough they were susceptible to Leeds on the break, with Calvert-Lewin firing two warning shots either side of the break, Tel rattled the crossbar with a brilliant header in first-half stoppage time at the other end.\nSpurs could have entered the break with a more comfortable advantage after Kudus had blazed over following Udogie’s unchallenged run, but the winger signed from West Ham United more than made up for that miss by striking the winning goal.\nFrank introduced Kevin Danso and Pape Matar Sarr to shore things up at the back late on, but Leeds piled on the pressure and came close to an equaliser, only for Vicario to save Piroe’s close-range strike before Struijk's header was deflected wide late on.\nIt marks another excellent result in Frank’s early Spurs tenure, and he will be looking to build on that when they welcome Aston Villa to north London after the international break.\nLeeds report | Spurs report"

        "report": "Postecoglou launched an impassioned defence of his experience in Friday's pre-match press conference, referencing last season's UEFA Europa League success with Tottenham Hotspur.\nAnother bullish Postecoglou message may have been intended to fire up his Forest players, and it seemed to have some impact early on.\nTaiwo Awoniyi dragged wide just a minute in after a poor Gusto pass before Elliot Anderson failed to pull the trigger following Trevoh Chalobah's error.\nGibbs-White then passed up back-to-back chances in quick succession, and many may have been fearing the second-half collapse that followed after Forest failed to capitalise on their strong opening.\nHome frustration towards Postecoglou was evident as jeers greeted Douglas Luiz's removal in the 53rd minute, though Forest did continue to create chances before a late James sucker-punch.\nWilliams struggled to keep down left-wing cross with a first-time strike, and Jesus' effort somehow stayed out in a passage of play that summed up Forest's recent struggles in front of goal.\nRegardless of those missed chances, Postecoglou became the first Forest boss to fail to win any of his first eight games, and not long after full-time, his time in charge was brought to an abrupt halt.\nForest will now look to make a new appointment ahead of Thursday’s UEFA Europa League match with Porto, with a trip to AFC Bournemouth following in the league.\nWith Cole Palmer expected to be out for another six weeks, Enzo Fernandez missing from the matchday squad and Moises Caicedo only fit enough for the bench, Enzo Maresca – serving a touchline suspension after he was sent off in Chelsea’s win over Liverpool last time out – was forced to rely on his squad players here.\nThat host of key absentees was notable as Chelsea lacked fluidity in the first half, creating their own problems on three occasions when unable to execute Maresca's possessional play across their backline.\nThe Blues did eventually settle as half-time approached, with Santos twice making late runs from midfield to link up with Joao Pedro, but failing to find the required clinical edge.\nBut an unimpressed Maresca still made a triple change at half-time with the introductions of Caicedo, Marc Guiu and Jamie Gittens soon having his desired effect.\nGuiu won the free-kick for Neto's goal and was generally busy, while Caicedo brought a much-needed calmness to their midfield as Chelsea never looked back from Acheampong's point-blank header.\nWith their next league game coming at home against promoted Sunderland, Maresca will be hoping to build on back-to-back victories and set his sights on keeping up the pace at the top of the table.\nForest report | Chelsea report"

        "report": "Villa had endured a tough start to the season with no wins from their opening five league matches along with an early EFL Cup exit, but three straight wins had injected a bit of optimism into the team.\nThey made a decent start here and found the net halfway through the first 45, with Malen finishing coolly.\nHis goal was even better for the second, striking an effort on the half-volley and into the far corner of the net after being set up by Rogers, who improved as the match wore on.\nMalen took both goals with aplomb as he enjoyed a rare league start, highlighting Villa’s strength in depth in the attacking positions and proving that they can still function and flourish without the goals of Ollie Watkins.\nThe only blot was the goal conceded from a corner, but after such a poor start, points are of paramount importance, and Villa now have momentum on their side for the first time this campaign.\nVilla travel to face Tottenham Hotspur after the international break and will be looking to continue their impressive streak in the capital on 19 October.\nDespite some battling displays this season, Scott Parker’s men were in desperate need of some points after a winless run that had already stretched to four matches in the league, before they visited Villa Park.\nThere were some encouraging signs for the Clarets in the first half, as they got into some attacking positions, but they struggled to convert those openings into clear-cut opportunities and failed to register a shot in the first 30 minutes.\nThe opening goal will have frustrated Parker, as they looked compact without the ball, but it only took one pass on the transition to completely expose the Burnley backline and provide Villa with the all-important opener.\nDespite going further behind, the Clarets did not fall away and found a way back through Ugochukwu from a corner, but it wasn’t enough to spark a comeback.\nParker will hope his side can register their second victory of the season when they host fellow promoted side Leeds United on 18 October."

However, they had generally struggled on the road this season.\nHaving given up leads in trips to Brighton & Hove Albion and Arsenal, as well as against AS Monaco in the UEFA Champions League in midweek, Guardiola might not have been overly comfortable despite Haaland’s strike.\nNico Gonzalez effortlessly replaced Rodri in midfield following his introduction as Man City continued to push for a second goal, and a bit of insurance, with Foden looking to come good against Brentford once more.\nFoden, who was omitted from Thomas Tuchel’s England squad earlier this week, kept pushing without getting a real sight of Kelleher’s goal as Brentford’s defence stood firm.\nMan City coped well against the rising Brentford pressure in the second half, despite some nervy mistakes, but Guardiola’s frustration continued to rise as he saw more chances go begging.\nIn the end, it did not cost him a landmark victory, and his team – who next face Everton on 18 October – kept leaders Arsenal and reigning champions Liverpool firmly in their sights."

        "report": "And that proved costly when Brian Brobbey brilliantly held the ball up before laying it off for fellow substitute Talbi, whose cool, low finish into the bottom-right corner sent the travelling Sunderland supporters behind the goal into raptures.\nChelsea not only saw their four-match winning streak in all competitions brought to an abrupt end, they also missed the chance to apply some pressure to leaders Arsenal.\nBallard's header inside the opening minute served as an early warning for Maresca's side that the visitors were not going to roll over.\nNevertheless, all seemed on track when Garnacho broke the deadlock soon after.\nHowever, the tables turned as Chelsea were undone by Mukiele's long throw, with Isidor taking full advantage of the ensuing chaos to cancel out their lead.\nDespite the setback, Chelsea carried the greater attacking threat thereon, and it took smart reflex saves from Roefs to thwart Garnacho from close range and then Chalobah from distance.\nHowever, the game’s third goal eluded them and they were stunned following a devastating stoppage-time counter, with Talbi’s lovely finish silencing the Stamford Bridge faithful, whose team had been on the end of a last-gasp winner in their previous home league outing, against Liverpool.\nMaresca’s side will look to bounce back against Wolverhampton Wanderers in the EFL Cup in midweek, before travelling across London to face Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday, but the Italian will know that this kind of result could be what costs Chelsea in their desire to really push on in a title challenge.\nBy any measure, it has been a fantastic start to the season for Sunderland on their return to the big time, and this result tops the lot.\nTheir tally of 17 points is their joint-best after their opening nine games in a Premier League campaign. Plus, the Black Cats are also now unbeaten in each of their last 14 league matches in London.\nSunderland’s confidence was epitomised by their purposeful start, and they were unfortunate to find themselves behind to Garnacho’s smart finish.\nThey responded well, though. Enzo Le Fee sent a free-kick narrowly over soon after, before another set-piece led to their equaliser, with leading scorer Isidor in the right place at the right time once again.\nAfter that, it was largely backs to the wall for the visitors, but, they dug deep and their efforts were rewarded in dramatic fashion.\nTerrific centre-forward play from Brobbey was integral. The former Ajax striker showed great strength to hold off his markers and then find the onrushing Talbi, who still had plenty to do with his finish.\nRegis Le Bris’ side will be desperate to continue this momentum heading into the next international break, with back-to-back home games coming up, first against Everton next Monday, and then Arsenal.\nSurely, not even the boldest of Sunderland fans would have thought that an encounter against the Gunners would be a potential top-of-the-table clash, but that is the state of play as it stands.\nChelsea report | Sunderland report"

        "report": "And, with confidence high after earning a last-gasp comeback win over Crystal Palace in their last home match, Everton started on the front foot, helped by the return of Grealish, who was ineligible to play at Manchester City last weekend.\nJust three minutes in, Grealish met Ndiaye’s cross on the volley, but Porro was on hand to block it on the line ahead of a scrambling Vicario.\nAfter twice being caught out when Spurs crowded bodies into the box on corners – and seeing a goal of their own chalked off – the home faithful’s frustration was clear at half-time, but Everton took motivation from it.\nNdiaye, a bright spark throughout, sent an audacious flicked attempt wide of the post and forced Vicario into a sharp stop at his bottom-right corner on either side of Beto’s strike as Everton put up a fight.\nIt fell flat in the end, though, with Spurs getting their insurance goal late on, and Everton will look to respond to their back-to-back defeats when they travel to Sunderland next weekend.\nSpurs have had their troubles at home in recent weeks, but their outstanding away form continued on their first trip to Hill Dickinson Stadium.\nNo team has won more points on the road than Thomas Frank’s side this term, and they were clinical to keep themselves in the mix at the top of the Premier League table.\nMore set-pieces gave them joy, with Van de Ven twice left with simple finishes in front of the goalkeeper, with Porro putting in a particularly inviting cross at the end of the first half, giving Pickford no chance.\nHowever, even with a strong 2-0 lead, Spurs may not have felt overly confident given their recent history of squandering advantages, including in their loss to Aston Villa last week.\nBut they were happy to sit back and frustrate their hosts, with Vicario picking up where he left off in their 0-0 draw with Monaco in the UEFA Champions League in midweek, making several fine saves to protect his clean sheet.\nTheir defensive base, spearheaded by the match-winner Van de Ven, stood firm to the very end, and Spurs can now turn their attentions to a trip to Newcastle United in the EFL Cup before hosting Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday.\nEverton report | Spurs report"

        "report": "Without the suspended Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, David Moyes handed a full league debut to Tyler Dibling, but the winger struggled to make an impact in a first half dominated by Palace.\nPickford, who was making his 300th Premier League appearance for Everton, made several key interventions, denying Pino, Guehi, and Mateta inside the opening 30 minutes.\nMoyes was swift in his response, switching Dibling and the misfiring Barry out Charly Alcaraz and Beto at half-time, and these changes proved effective.\nAlcaraz added energy and spark into Everton’s midfield, while Beto showed the hustle that endeared him to Toffees fans last season.\nIroegbunam was also impressive from the bench, and he forced the error from Lacroix while chasing what appeared to be a lost cause – Ndiaye knocking in the subsequent spot-kick.\nEverton’s response then went from good to great, with Ndiaye turning from goalscorer to provider as his cross wreaked havoc in the Palace six-yard box, with Grealish finding the winner in the ensuing carnage.\nGrealish will not play when Everton travel to Manchester City after the international break, but the Toffees can go into that game with confidence after maintaining their unbeaten start at home.\nThe Eagles landed a win in their first ever European tie on Thursday, as they started their UEFA Conference League journey by beating Dynamo Kyiv 2-0, on the back of dramatically overcoming Liverpool in their previous top-flight outing.\nThey carried that excellent form into the first half here. Adam Wharton, a notable omission from Thomas Tuchel’s England squad for the upcoming internationals, once again played a key role in the Eagles’ build-up.\nLinking effortlessly with Daichi Kamada and Pino, he helped drive wave after wave of dangerous counter-attacks.\nWhile their first-half opener was much-deserved, Palace’s profligacy after the break was ultimately their undoing. Mateta, in particular, was guilty of some wasteful finishing.\nLapses in focus by Lacroix for the Everton penalty, and then by the entire defensive unit for Grealish’s winner, saw Palace’s status as the Premier League’s only unbeaten team in 2025/26 come to an end.\nPalace will aim to recover from their first competitive defeat since April when they face AFC Bournemouth on 18 October."

        "report": "Alexander Isak snatched at his one big chance, seeing a shot smothered by Senne Lammens midway through the first half.\nGakpo toiled and tussled, three times frustrated by the frame of the goal before his luck finally turned, after Slot boldly switched to 4-2-4.\nYet Gakpo and the bright Chiesa aside, Liverpool’s attack faltered, with Salah particularly short of form.\nThe Egyptian spurned a glorious opportunity when he was picked out by Milos Kerkez at the back post, but was otherwise on the fringes, and he was subbed off in the 85th minute.\nThis should just be a bump in the road for an elite team, but Slot will know the importance of stopping the rot soon. Liverpool face Eintracht Frankfurt on Wednesday, before heading to Brentford for their next league outing.\nIs this finally lift-off for Ruben Amorim at Man Utd?\nThe Red Devils managed an admirable 2-2 draw in the corresponding fixture last season, and also claimed a huge win at Manchester City, but those results ultimately proved false dawns. But this time, will it be different?\nMan Utd, for all their troubles, are into the top half and within touching distance of the top four. Even at this early stage, that will be a huge morale boost.\nIt could hardly have been a more ideal start for the visitors. Mbeumo deserves all the credit – he reacted sharply after that collision with two Liverpool players and showed a great burst of pace to get behind Van Dijk, and then great composure to finish past Giorgi Mamardashvili.\nIt could easily have been more for Man Utd, too, even if they did ride their luck at the other end. Fernandes was frustrated by the woodwork and Mason Mount shot at Mamardashvili before half-time.\nIt was more of a counter-attacking approach for Man Utd after the interval, with Matheus Cunha excellent as a link between defence and the forward line, while Fernandes worked tirelessly in midfield.\nGakpo’s goal did not take the wind out of Man Utd’s sails, either, and when the big moment came, Maguire was on hand to secure a win that might just prove Amorim’s team are on the right track. They host Brighton & Hove Albion next week."

They have now scored 37 goals from corners in the Premier League since the start of the 2023/24 season, at least 16 more than any other team.\nFrom there, the Gunners’ strong defence was able to navigate the remainder of the contest, doing what Fulham had done to them in the first half, with this result sending a message to their title rivals.\nArsenal return to UEFA Champions League action on Tuesday as they welcome Atletico Madrid to Emirates Stadium, before they host Crystal Palace in the league next weekend.\nFulham report | Arsenal report"

        "report": "Brentford rise to 13th on 10 points, while West Ham remain in the relegation zone, three points behind Burnley in 17th.\nThe Bees came to life 30 minutes in, with Thiago getting the first in a flurry of chances when he turned Dango Ouattara’s knock down on to the crossbar.\nMikkel Damsgaard’s glancing header then forced Areola into a fine stretching save as Brentford continued to cause problems with set-pieces before Ouattara’s thumping effort was cleared off the line by Bowen.\nHowever, Brentford’s goal came from a long ball in the 43rd minute. Kevin Schade brought it down between two defenders before squaring it to Thiago, and Areola helped it into the net despite getting a full hand to it.\nKelleher then tipped Bowen’s shot wide before Thiago thought he had a second. He latched onto Damsgaard’s through-ball and dinked over Areola on the stroke of half-time, but the goal was disallowed for offside following a VAR check.\nAn unmarked Schade then rattled the crossbar with a powerful header just past the hour before Keane Lewis-Potter whipped a curler narrowly wide late on, but substitute Jensen rifled his effort into the roof of the net in the fourth minute of stoppage time to cap off a commanding win.\nAfter two away games to start his West Ham tenure, Nuno stepped out for his first match at the London Stadium, with the Hammers looking for their first points on home soil this season.\nAnd West Ham started well, forcing several early corners without reward, before being put on the back-foot, with Brentford using set-pieces to exploit their defensive fragility.\nAmid chaos in the box, the hosts initially threw bodies on the line to thwart Brentford. However, they were exposed for Thiago’s goal by Kristoffer Ajer’s long ball, with Schade darting between two defenders to bring it down. Areola will also feel he should have done better.\nThere were signs of life in first-half stoppage-time, as Bowen found a pocket of space to register their first real chance, but they did not build on that, instead, almost giving up a goal immediately after.\nA triple change from Nuno preceded the second half as he sought defensive stability, but their struggles at the other end also continued. Crysencio Summerville and Lucas Paqueta, on his 100th Premier League appearance, both fired well off target when chances fell their way.\nBoos rang out at the London Stadium at the end of both halves, and Nuno will be hoping to get off the mark at West Ham on Friday away to promoted Leeds United.\nBrentford had lost all three of their away games before Monday, but having won more Premier League matches against West Ham than any other team, they will have been confident ahead of this game.\nThey took time to grow into the contest, and even though they took a 1-0 lead into the break, they could easily have had more. Schade saw two shots go to waste in the first 10 minutes, poking a low effort into the side netting before a looping header was claimed by Areola after two counter-attacks.\nThiago refused to let up the pressure, as he contributed heavily to Brentford’s 15 first-half shots – their most in a Premier League away game – and proved a thorn in West Ham’s side, getting a stroke of luck with his goal.\nHaving lost out on a second by the offside flag before the break, Thiago kept Areola busy in the second, with the goalkeeper getting down sharply to deny him from a tight angle late on.\nWith West Ham down to 10 men in the closing stages, due to Konstantinos Mavropanos’ injury and having made five substitutions, they took advantage, with Jensen, in acres of space, showing excellent composure to wrap up the three points.\nThey now return home, looking to build on this victory against struggling champions Liverpool at the weekend.\nWest Ham report | Brentford report"

Before that, however, they face Liverpool in the EFL Cup — a side they have already beaten twice this season, in the Community Shield and the Premier League.\nArsenal report | Crystal Palace report"

        "report": "Their reward for that stoic structure was a goal straight off the training ground, with Cash's emphatic effort leaving Donnarumma a mere statue.\nIn truth, while it was a game where Villa so often had to be patient and defend resolutely on the way to recording a first home league clean sheet since the opening day, Emery's men had the better opportunities.\nWhen City did get shots in at goal, time after time their big guns were denied by brave blocks and last-ditch interventions, as a Villa defensive masterclass provided the foundation for victory.\nEmery will be thrilled with the response his side showed to Thursday's disappointing setback to Go Ahead Eagles in the UEFA Europa League, and Villa's four straight league victories have made their underwhelming start to the campaign – in which they failed to win any of their opening five top-flight matches – a distant memory.\nThe only sour point was the sight of Buendia, creator of the only goal and so influential in these opening months of the season, limp off in the first half.\nBut, even accounting for that, the mood at Villa, who have now beaten City three times in a row on home turf, will be sky high this evening before they turn their attention to a massive clash with champions Liverpool at Anfield next Saturday.\nCity have really built around feeding Haaland this season, a fact emphasised by the Norway ace's 11 Premier League goals.\nHis big opportunity shortly after Cash's opener felt like a huge moment in the game and, given the form he has been in, you would have expected him to score it 99 times out of a hundred.\nBut there has been a feeling over the past few weeks that City need more of their attack-minded players contributing to the goals scored column, a train of thought exacerbated by the fact they mustered just one shot on target in the first half and only four from a total of 18 efforts by full time.\nGoing the other way, there were issues too. Villa had joy when attacking at right-back Matheus Nunes, while there was more than on occasion where it was a little too easy for the hosts to get through City's midfield.\nTo write City off by the end of October would be foolhardy in the extreme, but if they are to chip away at Arsenal and provide a sustained threat in the title race it appears obvious that Haaland needs a little more help.\nPep Guardiola's men have a chance to bounce back quickly next week as they travel to face Swansea City in an EFL Cup round-four tie on Wednesday, before a crunch home clash with high-flying AFC Bournemouth on Sunday.\nAston Villa report | Man City report"

        "report": "Instead, City’s No 9 watched as Savinho and Jeremy Doku hit tame efforts at Pickford, while Ake squandered a free header.\nBut when his first opportunity arrived, Haaland made no mistake. Rising to meet O’Reilly’s well-weighted delivery, he powered home a towering header after Michael Keane had switched off in Everton’s defence.\nHaaland, though, is an unstoppable, irresistible force. His crisp shot for City’s second caught James Tarkowski off balance, and the flick carried it beyond Pickford’s reach.\nThe Norway international has now scored 11 goals in City’s first eight league games of 2025/26. It’s only the third time a player has scored 10 or more goals in his team’s first eight matches of a Premier League season – and Haaland is the man responsible on each occasion, having previously done so in 2022/23 and 2024/25.\nHaaland has scored City’s last five top-flight goals and is now just four short of reaching 100 in the competition. It could easily have been three remaining, but two rare moments of hesitation allowed Pickford to frustrate the league’s leading scorer, who will look to continue his remarkable run against Aston Villa next week, after a UEFA Champions League match with Villarreal on Tuesday.\nWith Jack Grealish unable to play against his parent club, the onus fell on Ndiaye to provide the creative spark for Everton this time out, and the Senegal international certainly did just that.\nParticularly in the first half, Ndiaye was a livewire. His first highlight came as he pounced on Ake’s slack pass and crossed in for Beto, who should have done better.\nNdiaye turned creator when Beto was put through one-on-one just after 30 minutes, with the striker dragging wide before being flagged for offside, although the replays suggested it would have been a tight call had Everton’s No 9 converted.\nBeto’s movement posed questions for City’s defence in the first half, but the quality was lacking, and David Moyes is struggling to get much consistency out of either of his striker options at present, with Thierno Barry coming on for the final stages.\nNdiaye found himself on the fringes of the action after the break, though he did cross in for Merlin Rohl to head into the side netting after Haaland had put City in control.\nEverton, who are now winless in 17 league matches against City, can at least take positives from their first-half display, though, as they prepare to host Tottenham Hotspur at Hill Dickinson Stadium, where they remain unbeaten.\nMan City report | Everton report"

At the other end, Yankuba Minteh wasted chances, failing to make contact with a Welbeck cross before being pickpocketed by a backtracking Cunha when one-on-one with the goalkeeper.\nGeorginio Rutter had the opportunity to change the tide on the stroke of half-time, pulling away at the back post to meet Maxim De Cuyper’s cross, only to fluff his lines under little pressure.\nHurzeler’s triple change on the hour sparked some lift into Brighton, with Minteh seeing a teasing cross excellently tipped wide by Senne Lammens, but United’s defence initially stood firm against them until Welbeck’s sensational effort.\nFerdi Kadioglu’s long-range attempt was pushed away by Lammens prior to Kostoulas giving the travelling supporters real hope of a miraculous comeback, but it was not to be.\nBrighton are back in action against Arsenal in the EFL Cup in midweek, before they host Leeds United.\nMan Utd report | Brighton report"

Yet, they went into the break two goals behind, with Sels helpless to deny Kroupi's wonderful long-range strike.\nForest did improve after the break, aided by Dyche’s triple-change at half-time. However, they were lacking a cutting edge in the final third, with their four shots on target yielding an xG of just 0.35.\nDyche, whose last Premier League game was also on this ground with Everton in January, and Forest will welcome the prospect of a home double-header against Manchester United and Leeds United, with the opportunity to potentially build some positive momentum heading into the international break.\nBournemouth report"

        "report": "But the Cherries roared back and thought they had won it when Marcus Tavernier’s cross was tucked home by Christie, but following a clumsy foul on Guehi inside the box by Diakite, Mateta made no mistake to complete his hat-trick and a remarkable comeback.\nPalace’s club record 19-match unbeaten run was undone just before the international break as they lost 2-1 to Everton late on, despite going a goal in front and dominating the match at times.\nThey remained unchanged for the visit of Bournemouth but struggled to get going in the early stages, with the visitors pressing the home side at any given opportunity and limiting them to few chances in the opening minutes.\nThey began to settle down, however, with Adam Wharton showing composure in the middle of the park while the dangerous Pino began to threaten on Palace’s left side, creating their best opportunity of the half with a sweeping cross to find Mateta.\nA rare error from captain Guehi contributed to the home side conceding another before the half-time whistle, and they were in danger of losing a second Premier League match in a row.\nBut a thrilling second-half performance saw them get back on level terms on two separate occasions, with Mateta finding his scoring touch to great effect as he registered his first league goals in front of the Selhurst Park faithful this season.\nThey showed a wonderful fighting spirit, a key feature under Oliver Glasner since his appointment, which was epitomised by Mateta’s late heroics, but their attention will now turn to the UEFA Conference League as they host AEK Larnaca on Thursday.\nBournemouth’s best start to a top-flight campaign continued before the international break, as they came from a goal down in the second half to defeat Fulham 3-1 at a rain-soaked Vitality Stadium.\nIraola made three changes at Selhurst Park, but it did little to disrupt the Cherries’ rhythm as they made yet another fast start, going ahead with their first goal from a corner this season as Kroupi arrived at the right time to head home.\nSemenyo, who went close early on with a well-struck effort, proved integral for the second goal as his run and cross led to Kroupi once again finding the net with a smart finish on the volley.\nThe young Frenchman, who scored 22 goals in Ligue 2 for Lorient last season, led the line impressively and is likely to reduce the burden on Evanilson as the season progresses.\nBut the visitors tired as the match wore on and were second best after the break, but they looked to have won the game as substitutes Tavernier and Christie combined late on.\nHowever, Diakite’s error of judgement from a corner denied the Cherries the chance to go top of the league.\nBournemouth’s next match is a home encounter with managerless Nottingham Forest, who parted ways with Ange Postecoglou after their 3-0 defeat to Chelsea at the City Ground.\nPalace report | Bournemouth report"

The former now has six Premier League goals this season, with only Manchester City's Erling Haaland (eight) ahead of him in the Golden Boot race. The Dutchman's strike, meanwhile, was worthy of winning any match.\nSeveral teams could overtake Bournemouth in the table over the weekend, but the Cherries have a result to savour during the international break, ahead of visiting unbeaten Crystal Palace on 18 October.\nAfter back-to-back victories over Leeds and Brentford, Fulham's positive run was halted by a 3-1 defeat to Aston Villa last week, despite them taking an early lead through Raul Jimenez's header.\nBut eight minutes after his goal, Jimenez was withdrawn and appeared to be in major discomfort as he clutched at his hip. With Rodrigo Muniz already sidelined due to a hamstring issue, Adama Traore played the rest of the game as a makeshift striker.\nOn Friday, it was the turn of 18-year-old Josh King to lead the line, but Fulham struggled to make it stick up front throughout the first half.\nThe 14th-minute introduction of Cairney altered things, though, as he gave them a foothold in midfield after replacing Sasa Lukic, who became the latest Fulham player to suffer an injury.\nCairney's fellow substitute Chukwueze supplied the pass for Sessegnon's opener, but two moments of brilliance undid the Fulham backline.\nCastagne could not match Semenyo's pace and power for the Bournemouth equaliser, while Cairney was perhaps beaten slightly too easily in the build-up to Kluivert's wonder strike.\nMarco Silva will hope the international break allows some of his injured stars to recover, but Fulham must stew on back-to-back defeats during the hiatus, ahead of facing Arsenal at Craven Cottage in 15 days' time.\nBournemouth report | Fulham report"

        "report": "Elland Road bouncing again\nHaving seen their 23-game unbeaten league run at Elland Road ended by Tottenham Hotspur last time out, Leeds were aiming not to lose consecutive home league matches for the first time since May 2024, and they did so with relative ease.\nTheir red-hot start perhaps merited more than the two goals they scored, with Ao Tanaka firing a glorious chance over from just outside the box, before a last-ditch challenge from Maximilian Kilman stopped Aaronson from getting his brace.\nNot wanting to rest on their already comfortable advantage, Okafor, curled a fine strike narrowly wide of Areola’s far post. The visiting goalkeeper was then on hand to thwart Jayden Bogle’s near-post attempt, after the full-back linked up nicely with the influential Aaronson.\nBut for all of their attacking promise in the first half, Leeds struggled to carve out more clear opportunities in the second. It was Aaronson's deflected effort that sparked the home faithful back into life, as they looked to build real daylight between themselves and the bottom three.\nThey defended brilliantly throughout, but were denied a third clean sheet of the season when Fernandes picked out the bottom-left corner with his header late on. The visitors' goal mattered little for Leeds, who travel to Brighton & Hove Albion for their next Premier League assignment on 1 November.\nHammers hindered by individual errors\nAhead of kick-off, Nuno acknowledged the wholesale improvements West Ham needed to halt their recent slump. However, they failed to come to fruition as his wait for a first win in charge of the Hammers goes on.\nThey got off to the worst possible start, when Aaronson finished past Areola, before Rodon doubled Leeds’ advantage. What will frustrate Nuno the most is the ease with which Daniel Farke’s team were able to race in front.\nOllie Scarles was caught napping at the back post for the opener, before Rodon was easily able to run off Paqueta to score, as West Ham conceded from yet another set-piece.\nA few moments at the other end offered hope of a comeback with Bowen, who had earlier forced Lucas Perri into a save with his acrobatic effort, dragging a shot wide before he crossed for Tomas Soucek, who should have done better with his close-range header.\nWest Ham have never won a Premier League game when trailing by two or more goals at half-time, and they showed few signs of bucking that trend, with Callum Wilson’s ambitious 74th-minute flick being the closest they came before Fernandes’ late consolation.\nThings do not get any easier for West Ham, with Newcastle United the visitors to London Stadium next Sunday.\nClub reports\nLeeds report | West Ham report"

        "report": "To claim a victory over the reigning champions without so many regulars is a testament to Maresca’s work, even if he is helped by Chelsea’s abundance of talent in reserve.\nOnly one of Liverpool’s league matches this season has not featured a late goal – or, indeed, a late winner for either the Reds or their opponents, and that was the Merseyside derby two weeks ago.\nBefore that game against Everton, Arne Slot’s team had won all of their top-flight matches by hook or by crook – just about getting the job done. Now, they have lost to two stoppage-time strikes in successive games. Eddie Nketiah’s winner for Crystal Palace last week came in the 97th minute, and Estevao got Chelsea over the line two minutes earlier on this occasion.\nWhile optimistic Liverpool fans may have looked at their early-season displays as evidence of a title-winning mentality, others may have suggested the level of performance was being covered up by those last-gasp rescue jobs.\nAnd barring a spell around Gakpo’s equaliser, Liverpool were second-best here. Salah was largely on the fringes – he came alive once in the first half with a wonderful cross into Isak, who headed over. He looked sharper in the second half, though still some way short of his best.\nHaving introduced Wirtz at half-time, Slot made some brave adjustments early in the second half, an out-of-sorts Ibrahima Konate making way and Ryan Gravenberch going into the defence, but Chelsea regained control once they had rediscovered their composure.\nManchester United visit Anfield after the international break, and Slot will know his team need to get back into gear.\nChelsea report | Liverpool report"

        "report": "How the match unfolded\nCity took early control as Doku’s charge into the box forced Dubravka into a vital near-post save. Esteve tried to intercept an onrushing Phil Foden off the rebound but ended up poking the ball into his own net from close range.\nAn intense battle then unfolded down the left wing between Doku and former City captain Kyle Walker, with the Belgian causing constant plenty of havoc, though Burnley’s defence held firm.\nDubravka was called into action again moments later to block another Doku shot to the near post, but the Clarets soon found themselves on level terms against the run of play.\nQuilindschy Hartman’s low cross was met by Anthony, whose shot deflected off Ruben Dias and into the bottom corner.\nNunes restored City’s lead just after the hour mark with a crisp volley inside the box, following Haaland’s headed assist that capped some smart City build-up play.\nThe result never looked in doubt from there and, in the 65th minute, Oscar Bobb made an impact moments after coming on, playing his part in a move that led to Esteve scoring another own goal as the defender helplessly deflected Nunes’ cross past Dubravka.\nHaaland then ran riot against a tired Burnley defence, netting in the 90th minute and the third minute of added time with two clinical finishes: first from a low Doku pass, then converting a deflected ball over the top to seal City’s third win of the season.\nMan City turn up the heat\nPep Guardiola’s side came into the match already having ground to make up on the sides around them after Gabriel Martinelli’s late equaliser at Emirates Stadium had held them to a frustrating draw last weekend.\nThey initially needed little time to find their rhythm at home as Doku and Foden combined to force Esteve’s touch into his own net.\nBut the sunshine briefly dissipated at the Etihad as a familiar lapse of concentration, one that has troubled Guardiola’s defence in recent seasons, allowed in-form Anthony to capitalise in space inside the box.\nDespite controlling possession and the overall flow of the match, in attack City were taking a more direct approach with crosses into the box rather than their traditional patient passing build up in central areas.\nThe hosts really found their feet in the second half, re-establishing their dominance with ease as Josko Gvardiol’s cross was held up cleverly by Haaland before Nunes smashed home his first goal of the season.\nBobb made his mark and Haaland then added the cherry on top with his seventh and eighth goals of the league campaign to seal a comfortable triumph for City.\nThey will now shift focus to their away UEFA Champions League match against Monaco on Wednesday. They then return to Premier League action with a tough test away to Brentford next Sunday.\nEsteve unfortunate as Burnley well beaten\nBurnley would have arrived at the Etihad still licking their wounds after a poor midweek elimination from the EFL Cup at the hands of third-tier Cardiff City.\nIt has been a challenging re-introduction to life in the Premier League for Scott Parker’s side, who have managed just one win from their opening six fixtures so far this season.\nThe Clarets have a notably poor record against City, having now failed to win across each of their last 20 league visits, with their last victory dating all the way back to 1963.\nAnthony dragged Burnley level in the first half, though he was helped by a kind deflection, but the visitors never quite looked comfortable despite keeping City on their toes during that period of the match.\nAnd the Clarets’ evening in Manchester is best summed up perhaps by Esteve, who became just the sixth player to score two own goals in the same Premier League match.\nEsteve could hardly be blamed for either own goal, though, as a collective defensive lapse from Parker’s side saw them give up too many clear-cut chances that City’s forwards would have almost certainly put away even without the Frenchman’s interventions.\nThe Clarets will hope to fare better when they visit Aston Villa next Sunday.\nClub reports\nMan City report | Burnley report"

Marc Cucurella blazed their best chance of the first half over the crossbar just before half-time.\nHowever, with Maresca having used up three subs in the first half, he was left short of options after the break, meaning there was no chance for Alejandro Garnacho to come on and make an impact against his former club.\nChalobah’s effort ensured the momentum finished with Chelsea, but it was too little too late. The Blues are in EFL Cup action next, as they travel to Lincoln City.\nClub reports\nMan Utd report | Chelsea report"

        "report": "However, Nketiah had the final say, volleying through the legs of Alisson after showing brilliant composure to control Marc Guehi’s flick-on with his chest.\nSarr shines on return\nAlthough Nketiah will take most of the headlines following his winner, Sarr showed why he is so important to Glasner’s high-flyers.\nAfter returning from a two-game absence, not only was he on hand to give his side an early lead, but the 27-year-old was unfortunate not to register an assist after squaring the ball for Pino early on.\nSarr’s return also allowed Glasner to add another attacking dimension to his side.\nDaichi Kamada occupied the right-wing position in the two games prior, but he was moved into midfield alongside Adam Wharton for this fixture as Will Hughes dropped to the bench.\nThis allowed Palace to keep the pressure on Liverpool throughout the first half, with Kamada helping move the ball forward from deeper positions, while Sarr constantly troubled the Reds' backline with his pace.\nGlasner replaced Wharton with Hughes just after the hour-mark, after Liverpool started to gain some momentum, which allowed the hosts to be more stubborn off the ball.\nAnd another substitution, the 75th-minute introduction of Nketiah, proved inspired as he struck with virtually the last kick of the game.\nPalace will now bound into a busy week as they begin their UEFA Conference League campaign against Dynamo Kyiv next Thursday, before travelling to Everton three days later.\nSlot’s centre-back concerns\nLiverpool almost escaped with a point despite another unconvincing performance, but after Nketiah's winner, attention will turn to the champions' defensive frailties.\nGuehi attracted some of the spotlight ahead of this match after his reported Deadline-Day move to Liverpool fell through at the 11th hour, and the Reds’ struggles highlighted the reasons for Slot’s interest in the England international.\nIbrahima Konate had a very shaky start to the match, first getting dispossessed before Pino’s chance, then losing his footing when Mateta was played through on goal.\nGlasner’s side looked to capitalise on Konate’s nerves, with Mateta often standing next to his fellow Frenchman when receiving long-balls, instead of challenging Virgil van Dijk.\nGuehi, on the other hand, showed great confidence when carrying the ball forward as he looked to help Palace build on their early advantage, and he went on to assist Nketiah’s winner.\nAfter Giovanni Leoni was ruled out for the rest of the season with an anterior cruciate ligament injury, Slot will have to make do with just three recognised centre-backs until the January transfer window.\nWith trips to Galatasaray in the UEFA Champions League and Chelsea in the Premier League to come before the international break, Slot will be desperate for his central defenders to find some form.\nClub reports\nCrystal Palace report | Liverpool report"

        "report": "One of them, Marshall Munetsi, twice called Darlow into action in the space of three minutes; the Leeds goalkeeper tipping over a header before holding on to his fierce volley.\nThe hosts continued to carry the greater attacking threat as the second half wore on, but Leeds held out for all three points at Molineux.\nWolves have become the sixth team in Premier League history to lose each of their opening five matches in a season. They arrived into this game having lost their first four matches of a league campaign for the first time in their history.\nNevertheless, after guiding Wolves to safety last season, Pereira signed a new three-year deal earlier this week, and his players appeared rejuvenated as they made a positive start to this contest.\nThe Portuguese head coach handed a first Premier League start to Lopez and a first Molineux appearance for Krejci, and both players combined beautifully as the hosts drew first blood.\nHowever, it proved a false dawn for the hosts. While there was not much to be done about Bogle’s delivery for the Calvert-Lewin and the quality of Stach’s free-kick, Agbadou’s sloppy pass put them two goals behind at the break.\nDespite their strong response early in the second half – and the return of Jorgen Strand Larsen from injury – they were generally lacking a cutting edge.\nWolves have the opportunity to respond at home to Everton in the EFL Cup in midweek, before they look to finally get their first Premier League point of the campaign on the board at Tottenham Hotspur next Saturday.\nLeeds continued their impressive record against Wolves, who they have now beaten in each of their last four Premier League meetings.\nFarke’s side suffered late heartbreak at Craven Cottage last weekend, with Gabriel Gudmundsson’s stoppage-time own goal condemning them to a 1-0 defeat.\nThey were a little slow out of the blocks against Wolves and found themselves 1-0 down after Krejci’s neatly taken goal.\nThe signs did not look good at that point for Leeds, who had failed to win any of their seven previous Premier League games when conceding first.\nThe visitors had also only scored once since their return to the top flight, that coming courtesy of Lukas Nmecha’s late penalty against Everton in Matchweek 1.\nNevertheless, their struggles in front of goal certainly disappeared during an emphatic end to the first half, with Calvert-Lewin and Okafor getting off the mark for the club.\nLeeds will hope that gives their attacking threat a timely boost going into home matches against AFC Bournemouth and Spurs before the October international break.\nWolves report | Leeds report\nReferee: Anthony Taylor.

        "report": "Ayari’s strike may have been the highlight for Brighton, but Brajan Gruda impressed on what was his first league start of the season.\nWith Georginio Rutter moving into the striker role, Gruda slotted into the attacking midfield position, and Fabian Hurzeler will have liked what he saw.\nThe German youth international played a crucial role in Brighton’s opening goal, holding the ball up before finding Rutter, who then played Minteh through on goal.\nGruda was also involved with two chances just before the half-hour mark, teeing up a long shot for Ayari before missing the target with an effort of his own from distance.\nThe 21-year-old offered some security to Hurzeler’s midfield, too, with Gruda often dropping back to the edge of his own box in order to help out defensively.\nAlthough this meant the front three of Minteh, Rutter and Kaoru Mitoma were left to do more work on the counter, it is certainly food for thought for Hurzeler, especially with Danny Welbeck struggling to click into top gear, as Brighton aim to propel themselves up the table, and it was ultimately a frustrating day for the Seagulls after such a positive start.\nGruda, who was subbed off just after the hour and replaced with veteran James Milner, will hope to start again for Brighton when they face Barnsley in the EFL Cup, with a trip to Chelsea following in their next league match.\nSimons makes his mark as Frank mixes things up\nThis was the first time that Pape Matar Sarr – who was an unused substitute as Spurs’ squad was rotated following their UEFA Champions League exploits in midweek – did not start a match under Frank’s reign, and his absence was felt in the middle of the pitch for Spurs.\nThe visitors’ best chances in the first half came from wide areas as Lucas Bergvall and Rodrigo Bentancur opted to attack crosses.\nSpurs’ midfield also struggled when defending transitions, with their backline often left in one-on-one situations when facing counter-attacks.\nNew signing Simons also had to settle for a place among the substitutes, but the Dutch international certainly made a difference when he came on just after the hour.\nDeployed in a central role, Simons was swift to get in and around the action, as proved by his two chances, while it was he who played the pass out to Kudus in the build-up to Spurs’ equaliser.\nFrank is likely to mix things up again when Spurs face Doncaster Rovers next week, before they host lowly Wolverhampton Wanderers.\nBrighton report | Spurs report"

        "report": "Romero barely had to jump when he nodded Kudus' corner home in the first half. West Ham were let off on that occasion, but failed to heed that warning and some more slack defending allowed Sarr another unchallenged header at the far post.\nThat was the fifth goal West Ham have conceded from corners already this season, the most in the Premier League. And just when the hosts needed to keep cool heads, Soucek took a heavy touch on his chest and jumped into a rash challenge on Palhinha.\nThere has been little for West Ham fans to cheer in recent home games, and as was the case in their 5-1 defeat to Chelsea, there were swathes of empty seats by the final whistle.\nThey are back at the London Stadium again next Saturday, with the pressure firmly on ahead of a meeting with unbeaten Crystal Palace.\nAfter opening their Premier League campaign with victories over Burnley and Manchester City, Spurs were dealt their first setback under Frank two weeks ago, being thoroughly outplayed in a 1-0 defeat to AFC Bournemouth.\nFollowing that loss, Tottenham bolstered their attacking options with the signing of playmaker Simons from RB Leipzig and a loan move for Paris Saint-Germain striker Randal Kolo Muani.\nWhile Kolo Muani was an unused substitute, Simons was thrown in from the off, and he did not have to wait long for his first assist in the Premier League, supplying a pinpoint delivery for Sarr's opener.\nPlaying alongside Simons, Bergvall had a goal and an assist in a breakout performance, with the 19-year-old showcasing excellent technique when looping his header over Mads Hermansen.\nFrank will be just as pleased with his team's clean sheet, with West Ham rarely threatening after Lucas Paqueta skewed an early effort wide.\nThe only thing missing was a goal for Kudus, who ran the gauntlet on his first return to West Ham and was only kept out by a stunning Hermansen save late on.\nHaving suffered 22 Premier League defeats last season, Tottenham look like a different beast in 2025/26. They return to UEFA Champions League action against Villarreal on Tuesday, ahead of a trip to Brighton & Hove Albion next Saturday.\nWest Ham report | Spurs report"

Mateta highlighted his poacher instincts to find the net from close range and put Glasner’s men in control.\nDespite their impressive defensive record, they conceded a sloppy goal as Bowen was left completely unmarked at the near post to head home the equaliser.\nBut it was from the most unlikely of sources in Mitchell who restored their lead, with a striker’s finish at the far post to ensure Glasner and his men would extend their impressive unbeaten run to 17 matches in all competitions.\nAnd Palace will look to take that even further when they host leaders Liverpool, who they beat in the FA Community Shield in August, next weekend.\nWest Ham report | Crystal Palace report"

        "report": "But Saturday's match was largely a tale of frustration for Spurs. They struggled to make the most of some promising first-half situations, while Wolves threatened when they forced set-piece opportunities.\nSome static defending from a Jhon Arias corner was punished by Bueno, and if anything, Spurs regressed further from that moment on. The hosts were bullied in midfield, with Andre particularly impressive for Wolves, while wild pot-shots from Cristian Romero and Palhinha were sent flying over Johnstone’s goal.\nBut just as they appeared out of ideas, Palhinha shaped a lovely effort inside the bottom-right corner, earning a point that Spurs could scarcely say they deserved.\nFrank will be frustrated by his team's home form, after they were comprehensively outplayed in a 1-0 loss to AFC Bournemouth last time out at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, though the former Brentford boss will be mightily relieved to avoid defeat here.\nSpurs will need to show more in a busy week ahead, as they visit Bodo/Glimt in the UEFA Champions League, then travel to Elland Road to face Leeds United in the Premier League.\nWolves on the board but heartbroken\nWolves endured a defensive horror show in last week's 3-1 defeat to Leeds United, which prompted Vitor Pereira to make sweeping changes for Tuesday's EFL Cup tie at home to Everton.\nAnd following a morale-boosting 2-0 win over the Toffees, Pereira stuck with nine of his midweek starting XI, playing a back four in a Premier League game for the very first time.\nWolves started calmly, with the introduction of Andre giving them a foothold in midfield, but they initially struggled for creativity. Before Doherty side-footed against the outside of a post, speculative shots from Arias and Hwang Hee-chan were the sum of their efforts.\nAt half-time, Pereira introduced Jackson Tchatchoua and Emmanuel Agbadou and reverted to a three-man defence, and it was Bueno – shifted out to the right of that trio – that came up with the opener.\nBueno was in the right place at the right time to score his first goal for Wolves, on his 56th appearance for the club, while he was also rock-solid defensively, making one heroic challenge to halt a marauding run from Xavi Simons.\nPhysicality was the name of the game for Wolves in the second half, and it served them well, but one moment of quality was all it took for two points to be snatched away from them.\nPereira now faces the difficult task of re-energising his players ahead of a home clash with Brighton & Hove Albion in eight days' time.\nClub reports\nSpurs report | Wolves report"

        "report": "His clever lob was exceptional, and came from the Reds’ first attempt, even if the pressure had been building. And moments after he was evaded by Grealish down Liverpool’s right flank in the build up to Dewsbury-Hall’s chance, Gravenberch provided a neat assist for Ekitike, who continued his superb start to life on Merseyside.\nHowever, Liverpool’s vulnerability when in the lead came back to bite them again as they started the second half sluggishly. But Slot will no doubt be pleased with how his side regained a measure of control, with the Reds having now won their last five home derbies.\nNext up is another home game, against Southampton in the EFL Cup, with a trip to Crystal Palace following in the league.\nThere has been a sense of optimism about Everton in recent weeks. Much of that positivity has centred around a much-improved attacking unit, with Grealish, Ndiaye and Dewsbury-Hall all in strong form, even if the striker options ahead of them – Beto and Thierno Barry – have struggled to get into their groove.\nEven in a 0-0 draw against Aston Villa last week, Everton were the dominant force, but as has often been the case at Anfield – where David Moyes has never won a Premier League game – the Toffees could not replicate the level they have displayed against other teams, at least in the first half.\nVitalii Mykolenko’s return from injury meant James Garner went back into midfield, but Everton’s central trio was cut apart during Liverpool’s dominant opening 30 minutes.\nIt took until first-half stoppage time for Everton to have a shot on target, with Gueye’s scuffed effort causing little trouble for Alisson. But Gueye made no mistake when presented with his next opportunity.\nEverton turned in a much better second-half performance, and the frustration for Moyes will be that his changes could not capitalise on Liverpool’s drop-off, and the Toffees will now hope to get back to winning ways when they take on Wolverhampton Wanderers in the EFL Cup.\nLiverpool report | Everton report"

        "report": "The hosts had the better chances after the break, with Bayindir producing a fine stop to deny Dango Ouattara’s goal-bound effort. Amorim’s men were handed the chance to level the game from the spot when Collins hauled Mbeumo back in the area.\nThe Brentford captain escaped a red card after a VAR check for the denial of a goal-scoring opportunity, with the on-pitch decision of a booking confirmed as it was deemed that Mbeumo was not in control of the ball.\nBut having missed a penalty in the capital at Fulham this season, Fernandes again failed to convert from 12 yards as Kelleher sprawled down to his left to parry the shot away.\nUnited continued to push for an equaliser, but were punished on the break when substitute Jensen cut inside from the left and sent a fizzing shot beyond Bayindir.\nKeith Andrews had been enduring a mixed start to life in Premier League management, with his Brentford team without a win in the top flight since Matchweek 2 against Aston Villa, but they got their campaign back on track here with a statement result.\nThe Brentford boss opted to restore club-record signing Ouattara to his forward line, and that injection of pace had the United back line stretched in the early exchanges, even though it was Thiago who struck the decisive blows with two fine finishes in quick succession.\nSesko’s goal meant there were some visible Brentford nerves, understandably given they had dropped eight points from winning positions this season, more than any other side in the division.\nBut the Bees kept things tight and were able to get themselves over the line here.\nThe game should have perhaps been out of sight when Van den Berg failed to test Bayindir on the stretch. Ouattara then squandered a glorious opportunity from inside the box, having been found by Schade after the lively German forward had got the better of Diogo Dalot down the left.\nThough hugely thankful for Kelleher’s penalty stop, this is a result Brentford will aim to build on, with their next Premier League match against Manchester City on home soil next Sunday.\nAmorim arrived at the Gtech Community Stadium in search of back-to-back Premier League victories for the first time in his United tenure, though the home of Brentford has not been a happy hunting ground of late, and things threatened to get ugly early on.\nThiago’s opening goal was far too simple from a Brentford perspective, with Henderson’s pass from deep catching Maguire as he attempted to step out as the last man, and it could have looked much worse for Amorim’s men when the Bees’ No 9 notched his brace.\nBayindir came to United’s aid after producing two stunning stops in quick succession to deny headers from Sepp van den Berg and Collins, though the visiting goalkeeper had perhaps been at fault for Thiago’s second after parrying Schade’s cross back into danger.\nSesko’s first goal for the Red Devils since his big-money move from RB Leipzig was one of the few positives for Amorim.\nUnited huffed and puffed, but were made to pay for their lack of efficiency in the final third.\nIndeed, from Cunha’s saved shot in the 52nd minute until the full-time whistle, Fernandes’ missed penalty represented their only shot on target.\nThere remains plenty for the United boss to ponder, with the scrutiny on United’s inconsistent form continuing.\nAmorim will aim to enter the October international break on a high when United welcome Sunderland to Old Trafford next Saturday.\nBrentford report | Man Utd report"

Damsgaard, back in the team after illness, demonstrated brilliant awareness to cut out King’s attempted reverse pass, before slotting home his first league goal since last December.\nHowever, Brentford were then punished for their own lapse in concentration at the back, with Iwobi pouncing to equalise, while they were sliced open by his brilliant pass moments later.\nDespite their best efforts, there was no way back after Pinnock’s own goal, with Igor Thiago and Dango Ouattara unable to make their presence known in the final third.\nJordan Henderson, on his 500th league appearance of his career, struggled to instil a sense of control in Brentford’s midfield, and Andrews will have plenty to ponder on with no more away games before the international break.\nInstead, they will welcome the prospect of a home double-header before the international break, even if the two Manchester clubs provide the opposition.\nFulham report | Brentford report"

        "report": "And with the Sweden striker completing his British-record move to champions Liverpool on deadline day, Newcastle had to replace somebody who registered 29 goal contributions in the Premier League last season.\nNewcastle played their first three games of the season with only as a recognised striker, and their lack of attacking thrust certainly cost them in goalless draws with Aston Villa and Leeds United.\nHowever, in the last 48 hours of the window, Newcastle added Woltemade and . Though the latter has already sustained an injury blow, with no timeframe given for his return, Woltemade has hit the ground running.\nThe towering German showed some excellent touches on Saturday as he constantly involved himself in Newcastle's build-up play. He also put Premier League defenders on notice by ghosting behind Emmanuel Agbadou to score the deciding goal.\nWoltemade was only able to get through 65 minutes on his debut before he was replaced by Osula. But Newcastle's supporters have every reason to get excited about their attacking options, having also seen Anthony Elanga come off the bench against Wolves.\nWith Wissa and the suspended Anthony Gordon still to return, Howe will hope this victory kicks Newcastle's attack into life ahead of a busy period.\nThey open their UEFA Champions League campaign at home to Barcelona on Thursday, before visiting AFC Bournemouth in the Premier League three days later.\nAfter this defeat, Wolves have started a league campaign with four straight losses for the first time, in their 127th season in the Football League or Premier League.\nVitor Pereira's team have had issues at both ends of the pitch in recent weeks, and on Saturday, they were left to rue a series of missed chances in the first half.\nTheir direct approach from kick-off led to Gomes and Hwang going close inside the opening minute. Later, with the game still goalless, Fabian Schar made a heroic clearance to deny Tolu Arokodare a debut goal at the back post.\nGomes again went close with a header late in the first half, but Wolves' attacking momentum waned in the second half, as they sorely missed the imposing figure of injured striker Jorgen Strand Larsen.\nTo give themselves the best chance of winning matches and not dragging themselves into a relegation battle, Wolves must find a way of getting ahead in games. Next up for Pereira's men is a huge clash with Leeds at Molineux next Saturday.\nNewcastle report | Wolves report"

        "report": "Jarrod Bowen’s equaliser helped Nuno Espirito Santo claim a point in his first game in charge of West Ham United as they battled back for a 1-1 draw at Everton.\nBowen levelled with a deflected curling effort at Hill Dickinson Stadium in the 65th minute, the first competitive goal Everton have conceded since their move from Goodison Park.\nEverton had deservedly edged ahead through Michael Keane’s 18th-minute header, but they were unable to make their dominance count as West Ham – who appointed Nuno on Saturday – improved in the second half.\nTheir persistence was rewarded when El Hadji Malick Diouf’s lung-busting run ended with a cross flicking through to Bowen, whose wicked strike took a touch off Keane on its way in.\nThe draw leaves West Ham 19th in the Premier League table on four points, while Everton moved up to ninth on eight points, despite making it four winless games in all competitions.\nEverton forced Alphonse Areola into two early stops, with the visiting goalkeeper comfortably keeping out Beto and Iliman Ndiaye’s efforts, but West Ham's set-piece problems soon came back to haunt them.\nAreola was powerless as Keane brilliantly headed James Garner’s follow-up cross home, after West Ham only half-cleared the midfielder's initial corner.\nIdrissa Gueye and Garner went close after half-time, though Jordan Pickford had to be alert after a slack Jake O'Brien header allowed Crysencio Summerville through one-on-one at the other end.\nThat chance sparked West Ham into life before they deservedly levelled through Bowen’s deflected finish, with the winger slamming into Pickford's right-hand corner.\nWest Ham captain Bowen saw another chance robbed by a last-ditch James Tarkowski block, while Garner’s fierce piledriver was repelled by Areola late on, as both sides failed to find a winner.\nEverton needed a response after a derby defeat to Liverpool and their EFL Cup exit to Wolverhampton Wanderers, and started on the front-foot in the first half.\nDavid Moyes, managing against his former club, will have been disappointed that Everton could not double their lead when on top, with Gueye firing just over from outside the penalty area.\nHowever, Everton were then forced to weather a West Ham storm and looked the more likely side to concede, despite having controlled the game for much of the contest.\nJack Grealish attempted to get his team back in charge as the clock ticked closer to full-time, but instead the Toffees were left disappointed with a third straight Premier League game without victory.\nMoyes' side failed to truly test Areola with any of their three second-half shots on target, with the overriding feeling of frustration having allowed West Ham a way back into the game.\nTheir best chance in stoppage-time came from Grealish's offload to Garner, who could only sting the palms of Areola after driving through numerous defenders from just outside the box.\nMoyes will need a more clinical showing on Sunday if they are to beat Crystal Palace, who are the Premier League's only unbeaten side this season after beating Liverpool on Saturday.\nNuno was only sacked by Nottingham Forest earlier this month, but was thrown straight back into action on Merseyside just two days after replacing Graham Potter at West Ham.\nThere were early signs of the implementation of Nuno's counter-attacking style that brought so much success at Forest, evident when Summerville drove in from the left and crossed for Niclas Fullkrug, who miscued his shot.\nHowever, the same defensive fragilities that have plagued West Ham this season were on show for Everton’s opener. Konstantinos Mavropanos failed to track Keane, who finished expertly after Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall recycled back out for Garner to deliver.\nBut despite that early setback, West Ham looked the more threatening in the forward areas, with Bowen and Fullkrug both seeing half-chances pass them by after their equaliser.\nDiouf was another to impress down the left-hand side, powering down the touchline before his delightful delivery flicked off Keane and into the path of Bowen, who made no mistake.\nThough unable to find a winner, Nuno will surely focus on the positives from this display, ahead of a trip to set-piece specialists and title contenders, Arsenal, on Saturday.\nEverton report | West Ham report"

        "report": "Gabriel Martinelli scored a wonderful 93rd-minute equaliser as Arsenal salvaged a 1-1 draw against Premier League rivals Manchester City at Emirates Stadium.\nCity looked set to leave north London with all three points as they held out for the majority of Sunday’s huge match after Erling Haaland combined with Tijjani Reijnders to score an excellent breakaway goal in the ninth minute.\nPep Guardiola's team sat deep in an attempt to protect that lead, and even the half-time introductions of Bukayo Saka and Eberechi Eze failed to spark Arsenal into an immediate upturn.\nBut in second-half stoppage time, Eze dropped deep to loft a pass over City's backline, and Martinelli beat Gianluigi Donnarumma with a delicate, outside-of-the-boot lob.\nWhile Arsenal are back up to second place, they are already five points adrift of defending champions Liverpool. City, meanwhile, are three points back from the Gunners in ninth.\nCity scored from their first attack as Haaland offloaded to Reijnders inside his own half before continuing his run. The Norwegian received a return ball from the Netherlands international, then applied a cool finish into the bottom-left corner.\nIn front of a frustrated home crowd, Arsenal did not create an opening until Donnarumma denied Noni Madueke at his near post in first-half stoppage time.\nSaka and Eze came on after the break and the latter swiftly saw a ferocious half-volley parried by Donnarumma.\nCity then went close to a second goal against the run of play, but Haaland's angled drive was blocked by David Raya while Eze's clearance ricocheted off Declan Rice and spun over the crossbar.\nLeandro Trossard had an effort blocked and saw an enticing centre fizz across goal without a touch, while Jeremy Doku was unable to flick home from a tight angle at the other end.\nAnd just when it looked as though Arsenal were out of ideas, Eze's pinpoint pass found the run of substitute Martinelli, who took the ball in his stride before flicking over Donnarumma.\nWhen Arsenal faced Liverpool at Anfield in August, they only managed one shot on target in a toothless attacking display, and they could have few complaints when Dominik Szoboszlai's stunning free-kick condemned them to defeat.\nAnd the Gunners might regret their conservative approach in the first half of this match, which left them with too much to do after the interval.\nWith Martin Odegaard absent due to a shoulder injury and Saka only fit enough for a place on the bench after recovering from a hamstring issue, it was something of a surprise to see Eze start among the substitutes.\nArsenal spent much of the first half moving the ball from side to side without ever threatening to breach City's well-organised defence and Mikel Arteta recognised his team's shortcomings at the break, finally bringing on Saka and Eze.\nThe latter played a pivotal role in rescuing a point, dropping between Arsenal's centre-backs before picking out Martinelli's run with a wonderful over-the-top ball.\nBut in truth, Arsenal were limited to half-chances before that moment of inspiration from the Brazilian, who had replaced Jurrien Timber in the 80th minute.\nArteta will be relieved to avoid another damaging defeat to a direct rival, but five matches into 2025/26, his team are five points off the title pace.\nArsenal have plenty of time to eat into that deficit, but they will have to show more quality in the final third at Newcastle United next Sunday, with an EFL Cup tie at Port Vale to come before then.\nIt is no secret that there has been bad blood between Haaland and Arsenal in the past.\nAfter a dramatic 2-2 draw against the Gunners at the Etihad Stadium 12 months ago, Haaland told Arteta to \"stay humble\", and that jibe seemed to fire up City's rivals ahead of February's return fixture.\nAfter scoring in Arsenal's thumping 5-1 victory in that match, Myles Lewis-Skelly imitated Haaland's iconic meditation celebration.\nBut City's superstar striker opted against an over-the-top reaction after netting here, instead crediting Reijnders for his role in the sweeping move which ended with Haaland's sixth Premier League goal of the season (below).\nHaaland galloped half the length of the pitch before slotting home right-footed, leaving Gabriel Magalhaes – another Arsenal player he has clashed with in the past – trailing in his wake.\nWith Arsenal bossing possession from then on, City took a more direct approach than usual. But Haaland relished his tussles with Gabriel and William Saliba, giving the visitors a route to get up the pitch.\nIndeed, when Guardiola replaced Haaland with defensive midfielder Nico Gonzalez in the 76th minute, City were left without a focal point and invited additional pressure, which they could not absorb.\nIf he had his time again, Guardiola may well have altered that approach, and City may also see this result as two points dropped ahead of a busy week that begins with a visit to Huddersfield Town in the EFL Cup before hosting Burnley in the league."

No team have been relegated from the Premier League after earning 11 points from their first six games.\nThe Black Cats played over an hour with 10 men against Aston Villa last week after Reinildo Mandava’s sending off, yet they ended that game frustrated at having to settle for a 1-1 draw.\nAnd they showed similar fight to quieten the City Ground crowd during the first half on Saturday, remaining compact and denying Forest any space between the lines.\nIt would have been easy for Sunderland to sit back after going ahead, but they also started the second half on the front-foot, with Arthur Masuaku and Chemsdine Talbi having opportunities amid a scramble in the Forest area.\nWhen Forest's spell of pressure arrived, they found Roefs in inspired form. As well as denying Hutchinson and Igor Jesus, he also tipped an Anderson drive around a post and blocked a volley from Wood.\nLe Bris will want to keep his players grounded, but if the mythical 40-point mark is what Sunderland need to maintain their Premier League status, they are already over a quarter of the way there ahead of next Saturday's visit to Manchester United.\nNottingham Forest report | Sunderland report"

However, the centre-back was hurt in that incident and had to be replaced shortly after Arsenal's first goal.\nHaving barely threatened, Forest might have been relieved to reach half-time 1-0 down, but the game was effectively beyond them when Savona was caught ball-watching for Arsenal's second goal less than a minute after the restart.\nForest enjoyed a few bright moments afterwards, with Wood going close and Deadline-Day addition Dilane Bakwa looking lively off the bench.\nPostecoglou will try to take the positives and get to work on the training ground, with an EFL Cup tie at Swansea City and a Premier League trip to Burnley to come next week.\nArsenal report | Nott'm Forest report"

        "report": "The Toffees had the better of the opportunities throughout, but when they did find a way through a stubborn Villa defence, David Moyes’ team found goalkeeper Martinez in top form.\nMichael Keane headed over the bar, while former Villa star Jack Grealish sent a well-struck volley straight at Martinez in the first half.\nVilla absorbed the pressure but offered little in attack, with Martinez making a superb stop to tip a Keane header over in the second half, before the Everton centre-back nodded wide from a Grealish cross late on.\nUnai Emery’s side remain the only Premier League team yet to score a goal this season as they moved onto two points in 19th place, while Everton have seven points from their first four matches.\nHow the match unfolded\nEverton began with a barrage of decent chances, with the in-form Grealish pulling the strings.\nGrealish first floated a clever cross for Beto, whose header was kept out by Martinez before the flag was raised, and the Manchester City loanee might have opened the scoring himself when a stinging drive was blocked by Villa’s goalkeeper.\nVilla received a let-off just before half-time when Youri Tielemans nearly turned an Everton corner into his own net, only for it to roll harmlessly wide.\nBeto fluffed a close-range finish off a bouncing James Garner cross shortly after the interval, while Emiliano Buendia nearly broke the deadlock with a 20-yard strike that deflected off James Tarkowski and looped wide.\nThe Toffees continued knocking on the door as Martinez parried a dangerous cross from Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall straight to Jake O’Brien, whose follow-up was promptly blocked.\nGrealish then created two identical chances, clipping delightful crosses into the box for Keane, only for Martinez to react with stunning reflexes the first time before the defender headed off target for the second.\nLack of cutting edge costs the Toffees\nAfter winning the first Premier League fixture at their new Hill Dickinson Stadium, 2-0 against Brighton & Hove Albion, Everton were unable to make the most of their goalscoring opportunities this time out.\nThis was despite Grealish continuing his fine creative form with another impressive outing, this time against his boyhood club, as he was central to most of the Toffees’ play.\nMinutes before Grealish volleyed at Martinez, Everton should have taken the lead as Keane headed narrowly over the bar from Dewsbury-Hall’s set-piece delivery.\nBeto and his replacement Thierno Barry could have done better with their second-half openings, before Grealish produced two moments of magic that, on another day, might have resulted in Everton taking all three points.\nHaving been denied by Martinez with his first chance teed up by Grealish, Keane will be disappointed he could not score from the second, heading off target in the closing stages when he had much of the goal to aim at.\nNext up for Everton is a short trip to face the champions and their fierce local rivals, Liverpool, at Anfield.\nMartinez heroics spare Villa’s blushes\nVilla rolled into this outing low on confidence, having picked up just one point from their opening three Premier League fixtures.\nDespite a favourable record against Everton, having won four of their last five top-flight meetings, Villa did not live up to the high standards they have set themselves under Emery, who was without several key players due to injury.\nYet one of their stalwarts came up with the star display.\nMartinez sat out Villa’s 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace last time out, but after a mooted deadline-day move to Manchester United failed to materialise, the Argentina international was back in the side here, and Villa will be thankful for that.\nThe highlight was his reflex save to tip over Keane’s powerful header in the second half, as Everton upped the pressure.\nWhile Martinez’s return provided a sense of security at the back, the Villans’ struggles in attack persisted, though.\nTheir best chances of the afternoon came from two Buendia efforts - first, a hopeful 45-yard punt that zipped past the post, and then a strike from the edge of the area that sliced wildly off Tarkowski.\nEmery’s side will hope their scoring issues begin to fade when they face Brentford in the EFL Cup third round midweek before travelling to newly promoted Sunderland next weekend.\nEverton report | Aston Villa report"

Minteh created problems out wide, setting up the equaliser, and he was unlucky not to receive a penalty after a high challenge on him by Gusto went unpunished.\nBrighton’s determination to find a winner eventually paid off, and they were back to their normal goalscoring form in injury time, scoring twice to shut off Chelsea’s chances of getting anything from the game.\nDefensively, Brighton were also able to show their quality, keeping out Chelsea in the early stages. Jan Paul van Hecke produced an important block to keep out Estevao Willian, and Bart Verbruggen made several important saves.\nThey will look to continue their form next weekend, when they travel to Molineux , to take on the bottom-of-the-league side Wolverhampton Wanderers.\nChelsea report | Brighton report"

        "report": "Leeds had been on top in the first half, with Sean Longstaff going closest when he struck the woodwork just before the break, but they could not find a way past Fulham goalkeeper Bernd Leno.\nMarco Silva's side pushed on in the second period, with Emile Smith Rowe and Kevin – on his debut – going close before they finally got the breakthrough at the death.\nHow the match unfolded\nDominic Calvert-Lewin had the first chance of the match 16 minutes in, but his flicked header from Brenden Aaronson’s cross was straight at Leno.\nIn what was a very quiet first half, Longstaff went closest for Leeds two minutes before the break when his drilled first-time effort from Calvert-Lewin’s knockdown skimmed the top of the crossbar.\nAaronson then forced Leno into a save at his near post early in the second period before Kenny Tete made a last-ditch challenge to deny Noah Okafor, and Fulham grew into the game.\nDarlow was finally called into action in the 58th minute as he denied Wilson’s goal-bound free-kick, before also stopping a close-range effort from Muniz 10 minutes later to keep Leeds level.\nFulham continued to push, and second-half substitute Kevin forced a great fingertip save from Darlow in added time, and a wrong-footed Gudmundsson put the ball past his own goalkeeper from the resulting corner.\nFulham achieve lift off\nSilva will be glad to see his Fulham side get their maiden win of the campaign after frustration in their first three outings, but they were made to work at home.\nThey were far from their best in this game and did not register a shot until the 58th minute, when Rodrigo Muniz won a free-kick for the Cottagers.\nFulham struggled against Leeds’ low block in the first half but stayed firm against their visitors’ pressure. They did not fare much better after the break either, when their opponents held a higher line in search of a victory.\nThe hosts looked more dangerous following the introductions of Emile Smith Rowe and debutant Kevin, who also created a great chance for Lukic, who scuffed an acrobatic effort, in the final 10 minutes of the match.\nWith home games against Brentford in the Premier League and Cambridge United in the EFL Cup next for Fulham, Silva will be hoping that his team can now build on this win.\nFarke’s attack blunted again\nAfter a third consecutive game without a goal from Leeds, Daniel Farke will have plenty of questions on how he can get the best out of his forwards.\nCalvert-Lewin led the frontline for Leeds in this match, making his first Premier League start for the club, becoming the third different player to do so for Farke’s side in four league matches this season.\nThe former Everton striker was often used as Leeds’ outlet option as they looked to sit deep against Fulham before hitting them on the counter-attack, a system that looked like it could garner a reward.\nAlthough Calvert-Lewin was often isolated in the final third, he was a constant presence in the box when the visitors looked to send in a cross, highlighted by his early chance.\nHe always occupied the space between Calvin Bassey and Joachim Andersen; however, crosses from full-backs Gabriel Gudmundsson and Jayden Bogle were often off the mark.\nDespite promising signs from Calvert-Lewin, only Nmecha has scored for Farke in the league this season, though Longstaff was only inches away from changing that in the first half.\nWith a trip to Wolverhampton Wanderers followed by home matches against AFC Bournemouth and Tottenham Hotspur, Farke will be hoping his attack can kick into gear sooner rather than later.\nFulham report | Leeds report"

        "report": "Salah coolly fired home to win it, sending Liverpool back above Arsenal at the top of the standings on maximum points, while Burnley sit in 17th.\nJaidon Anthony, having scored in back-to-back games, caused Liverpool problems down the left flank, nearly scoring with a speculative effort that sailed just over in the seventh minute.\nLiverpool left-back Milos Kerkez struggled early on, having been booked for simulation in the 22nd minute. He was surprisingly withdrawn by Slot before half-time, with Andy Robertson brought on.\nRobertson had an attempt shortly after his introduction, while the Reds also failed to capitalise on crosses flashed across the goalmouth by Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike.\nWith Alexis Mac Allister swapped for Conor Bradley at half-time, Liverpool emerged from the interval looking sharper as they began to stretch Burnley, with Dominik Szoboszlai seeing his goal-bound strike palmed away by the outstretched gloves of Martin Dubravka.\nLiverpool saw substitute Federico Chiesa come close, and their cause was helped when Ugochukwu received his second booking after sliding in on Wirtz.\nThe three points nevertheless had to be secured from the penalty spot, as Salah powerfully drilled in following Hannibal’s blunder.\nIt is now two games in a row, against two of the Premier League’s biggest teams, that Burnley have come desperately close to earning a point, only to concede an agonising stoppage-time penalty.\nIt happened against Manchester United at Old Trafford prior to the international break, and on Sunday it was a similar outcome.\nHowever, in Liverpool – a side the Clarets had lost six consecutive home games to – they were facing a different beast altogether than that of Ruben Amorim’s team.\nHaving built a promotion-winning team on the back of a defence that conceded just 16 goals during the 2024/25 season, that steel was on show from Scott Parker’s team here.\nMaxime Esteve – a key member of the Burnley's promotion-winning side – was central to the home side's valiant defensive efforts, as his smothering presence negated Liverpool’s attacking threat. The centre-back successfully contained both Salah and Ekitike for large swathes of the match.\nEven after Ugochukwu was dismissed in the 84th minute,  Burnley’s defensive display deserved a point, but Hannibal’s mispositioned arm was their ultimate undoing.\nWhile this defeat means Parker’s side were unable to extend their unbeaten home record, they will be hoping they can get back on track in front of the Turf Moor faithful next weekend as they host Ange Postecoglou’s Nottingham Forest.\nTwo weeks after a spectacular 83rd-minute Szoboszlai free-kick gave the Reds a 1-0 win over title-rivals Arsenal, Liverpool were back in action, and back to leaving it late once more.\nThe Reds looked set to fail to score in the league for the first time in exactly a year, since they were beaten 1-0 at home by Forest.\nInstead, they found a way to take three points away from Turf Moor, and have now won their opening four Premier League matches for only the third time, having previously done so in 2018/19 and 2019/20 – their title-winning campaign.\nDespite racking up eight goals across their opening three games, Liverpool were surprisingly toothless in attacking areas at times, as they struggled to create many clear-cut chances.\nWith Isak now in the mix, Liverpool boast an embarrassment of riches in forward areas, and at times on Sunday, Slot may have wished he had called on him sooner than planned, despite his clear reluctance to throw the Swede in at the deep end.\nHowever, as they have done in every game so far this season, Liverpool persevered until the very end, and their efforts paid dividends.\nLiverpool, who are yet to truly get out of first gear this season, face a tough week ahead as they host Atletico Madrid in the UEFA Champions League on Wednesday, followed by Everton in the Merseyside derby at Anfield on Saturday.\nBurnley report | Liverpool report"

Only a last-ditch Trevoh Chalobah challenge prevented Igor Thiago from getting through on goal, while Chelsea’s entire team soon switched off from a free-kick, though they got away with it.\nHowever, Palmer swung the momentum in his team’s favour, as world class talents tend to do. His goal was his first in open play in the Premier League since January, though he finished in typically cool fashion.\nNeto became increasingly effective down the right as the match wore on, and Caicedo’s moment of magic looked like it would be enough.\nHowever, Chelsea never looked safe at the back, and Brentford’s equaliser will serve as a reminder of what they must improve on, especially if they are to get positive results from their next two games, with trips to Bayern Munich and Manchester United coming up.\nBrentford report | Chelsea report"

Without the suspended Lesley Oguchukwu, Deadline-Day signing Florentino was given his first start in midfield, performing expertly in front of the Clarets’ backline with a combative display.\nAfter being convincingly outgunned in a 3-0 defeat to Arsenal last week and then suffering a late collapse against Championship side Swansea City in the EFL Cup, Forest responded reasonably well here, securing the first point of Postecoglou’s tenure.\nForest had looked anything but sharp in recent weeks, heading into the clash on a run of three straight defeats across all competitions and without a win since their 3-1 opening triumph over Brentford on the opening weekend.\nThis time, though, they combined grit with glimpses of the expansive, high-tempo football their new boss has been trying to instil. Forest’s players, long accustomed to the pragmatism of Nuno Espirito Santo, had looked to have initially struggled with the demands of Postecoglou’s possession-heavy, attack-minded system.\nBut here, his ideas clicked more fluently, offering supporters plenty of hope.\nElliot Anderson was, once again, central to Forest’s display and subsequent control of the game. The England international, who received plaudits during his performances for the Three Lions during the recent international break, was constantly looking to drive his side forward with his progressive passing.\nAfter Postecoglou’s Tottenham Hotspur side conceded 65 goals in the Premier League last season, the Australian’s defensive nous has occasionally been the subject of questions, and Forest certainly looked susceptible to counter-attacks here, as they left themselves exposed in pursuit of a winner.\nBut were it not for seven saves from the impressive Dubravka, Postecoglou could well have been celebrating his first victory.\nHaving shipped 11 in their last five across all competitions, Postecoglou will demand further improvement, but this result felt like an important step in the right direction.\nForest are away to Real Betis as they return to continental football in the UEFA Europa League, a competition Postecoglou won with Spurs last season, before they host promoted Sunderland next Saturday in the Australian’s first home game in charge.\nBurnley report | Nott'm Forest report"

Burnley were unable to muster a late response.\nA disappointing 2024/25 Premier League campaign for Spurs saw changes over the summer, with Frank brought in as Ange Postecoglou’s replacement.\nIt was almost the perfect start in Frank’s first competitive match on Wednesday as Spurs looked set to clinch the UEFA Super Cup, but they gave up a 2-0 lead against Paris Saint-Germain before losing on penalties.\nDespite the result, the Dane had been positive ahead of the new league season, and the reasons why were on show from the start as they immediately put Burnley under pressure.\nRicharlison got a deserved opener, with Kudus endearing himself to the fans early on with some clever play to get to the byline down the right before picking out the Brazilian.\nSpurs struggled to maintain their pace as the first half wore on, but in the second, Richarlison proved a force that Burnley struggled against.\nThe 28-year-old arguably should have scored another earlier than he did, but his movement for his bicycle kick was impressive, as a partnership between him and Kudus begins to flourish.\nDominic Solanke continued his return from an ankle injury off the bench and dragged a shot just wide shortly after his introduction as Frank made a winning start ahead of a trip to Manchester City next weekend.\nBurnley impressed in the Championship as they earned automatic promotion, though they were dealt a tough opening test against the Europa League champions, and Scott Parker’s former side.\nThe Clarets have gone big in the transfer window to try and avoid relegation this season, but even with their many incomings, Parker has lost goalkeeper James Trafford, who played a key role, to Man City.\nBurnley had the best defence in the Championship in 2024/25, and after some early nerves, they did well to stifle Spurs later in the first half to give themselves a strong base.\nBut despite their many chances, Burnley struggled to test Guglielmo Vicario, who did not look comfortable in the first half when he awkwardly parried Josh Laurent’s looping shot out for a needless corner.\nJaidon Anthony provided a threat on the counter, while Hannibal Mejbri was through on goal before he dawdled and eventually ran into traffic just moments before Richarlison’s second goal.\nJohnson’s strike seemed to take the fight out of Burnley, who were frustrated as they felt Esteve was fouled by Richarlison in the build-up, leaving Parker with problems to solve ahead of their meeting with fellow promoted side Sunderland next Saturday.\nSpurs report | Burnley report"

        "report": "Calvert-Lewin had arguably the best chance of the game when he latched onto Jayden Bogle's pass with stoppage time looming, but his low drive was blocked by the legs of Pope.\nLeeds fail to fire\nLeeds' first game back in the big time was a memorable one as Lukas Nmecha scored a late winner against Everton, but Daniel Farke's men have since endured two fruitless road trips.\nThey were thumped 5-0 by Arsenal at Emirates Stadium last week before bowing out of the Carabao Cup with a penalty shoot-out loss to Championship strugglers Sheffield Wednesday.\nFarke will have hoped for some home comforts back at Elland Road, but like their visitors, Leeds showed little of substance in attack.\nNmecha replaced Joel Piroe to make his first Premier League start, but the German was a peripheral figure before he was replaced by Calvert-Lewin 20 minutes from time.\nHaving missed a glut of chances and skied his penalty at Hillsborough in midweek, Calvert-Lewin was busy during his late cameo, but he showed signs of rustiness when shooting straight at Pope from a great position late on.\nFarke will at least be encouraged by the way his side scrapped for a point, which could prove immensely valuable by the end of the campaign. Sean Longstaff epitomised Leeds' battling attitude, stopping his former Newcastle team-mates from getting into their rhythm.\nBut their failure to hit the target until the closing stages will be a concern, and Leeds could look to improve their attacking options before the end of the transfer window, ahead of a trip to Fulham on September 13.\nCan Woltemade fill striking void?\nIt is fair to say the spotlight has been focused on Newcastle's attacking options in recent months.\nWith Isak still not training with the squad and Gordon suspended following his red card in Monday's dramatic 3-2 defeat to Liverpool, Howe was forced into another rethink.\nThat lack of forward options led Howe to deploy a 5-3-2 system, with Murphy and new arrival Jacob Ramsey brought in for their first starts of the campaign.\nBut Newcastle failed to establish any control, and other than Murphy's two efforts, the closest they came to scoring was when Schar's shot struck Bogle and spun onto the roof of Perri's net.\nRamsey's full Magpies debut lasted just 45 minutes, while Anthony Elanga and Harvey Barnes were thrown on by Howe in the second half, but neither could exert much influence in tricky conditions.\nNewcastle will hope Woltemade – who scored 17 goals in all competitions for Stuttgart last season – can make an immediate impact after the international break, when they welcome struggling Wolverhampton Wanderers to St James' Park.\nBut before then, the Magpies are reportedly in the market for another forward, with Yoane Wissa and Jorgen Strand Larsen touted as potential targets. Isak’s future, of course, is also to be resolved one way or the other, and Howe will hope his team emerge from the final few days of the transfer window with greater depth in attack.\nLeeds report | Newcastle report"

        "report": "Milner was a key cog in City’s league triumphs in 2012 and 2014, before he moved on to be equally as impactful for Liverpool under Jurgen Klopp, and so it was fitting for the midfielder to open his Brighton account in the top flight – over two years after he joined them – against one of his former teams.\nHe celebrated by paying tribute to the late Diogo Jota, with Milner – now the second-oldest goalscorer in Premier League history – having taken the No 20 shirt this season in honour of his former Liverpool team-mate.\nHurzeler’s raft of changes proved a masterstroke, and a player 18 years Milner’s junior in Gruda capped off the turnaround by displaying the type of composure that Brighton lacked in their defeat at Everton last week.\nWith AFC Bournemouth coming up after the international break, Hurzeler will hope this superb comeback proves to be a jumping-off point for another strong season.\nCity lose control\nCity’s sluggish display against Tottenham Hotspur last time out will have served as a haunting flashback to parts of last season for Pep Guardiola, and with the Manchester derby coming up after the international break, City needed a positive response.\nFor much of this encounter, it looked as if they would get just that.\nCity had full control for the first hour, and the reintegration of Rodri, making his first Premier League start since he suffered that serious knee injury against Arsenal in September 2024, certainly helped.\nBut it will take a while for the 29-year-old to get back to his best level, and once Brighton found that new wave of energy after the changes, City lost their grip on the game.\nIt seemed as though Trafford would get them out of trouble when he acrobatically thwarted Van Hecke, but the vulnerability City displayed in 2024/25 was back on show again – they also fell to a 2-1 defeat in the corresponding fixture last season, having gone ahead through a Haaland goal.\nAfter starting the season so well with a 4-0 rout of Wolverhampton Wanderers, there will now be real pressure for City to stop the rot when Manchester United visit the Etihad Stadium on 14 September.\nBrighton report | Man City report"

The former AC Milan midfielder brilliantly weaved between Joao Gomes and Andre in the build-up to City's opener, bypassing Wolves' midfield single-handedly before finding Lewis with a clever pass over the top.\nAnd when Wolves surrendered possession cheaply three minutes later, Reijnders made a lung-busting run to Bobb's left, then finished across Sa with aplomb.\nOne position City have not looked to fill in the transfer market is right-back, and though Lewis has been linked with Nottingham Forest in recent days, he stated his case for a regular starting berth with an excellent assist for the first goal.\nWith all the changes behind him, Haaland remains a constant threat up front. He has now scored on all four of his opening-weekend appearances in the Premier League. Ahead of a home opener against Tottenham Hotspur next Saturday, Man City look the real deal.\nQuickfire double leaves Wolves beaten\nVitor Pereira had a transformative effect after taking the reins at Molineux midway through last season, leading Wolves away from the relegation zone in style.\nHowever, with flair players Matheus Cunha and Rayan Ait-Nouri – who made his City debut in the Premier League here – joining dependable duo Nelson Semedo and Pablo Sarabia in seeking pastures new, there are a few question marks.\nWolves enjoyed a positive spell after Haaland's early miss, but Munetsi was caught offside both for his disallowed header and when the ball fell kindly for him at the far post moments later.\nThey were made to regret their failure to make the most of those opportunities when two goals in 180 seconds swung the game City's way. Pereira will be particularly irked by the second, which came after Agbadou sold Gomes short.\nWolves enjoyed another bright spell early in the second half, but Sa arguably should have done better for City's third goal after getting a hand to Haaland's strike.\nWith the game gone, Pereira introduced new signings Arias and Fer Lopez, and the former looked particularly lively, offering some encouragement ahead of next week's trip to AFC Bournemouth.\nFor most Wolves fans, however, the enduring image of Saturday's game will be the emotional pre-match tribute to Jota, who was honoured with a stunning tifo covering the South Bank.\nWolves report | Man City report"

        "report": "And with their first real attempt, Unai Emery’s side almost got themselves level just before half-time, but ’ effort was thwarted at point-blank range by Dean Henderson.\nVilla improved in the final third after the break but were unable to find a way through, and they were hit with a sucker punch on the counter when Guehi curled the ball beyond Bizot’s grasp.\nIt got even better for Palace late on, with Jefferson Lerma’s long throw-in flicked on by Maxence Lacroix for Sarr to nod home at the back post to seal all three points.\nThe pre-match build-up for Villa centred on the news of Emiliano Martinez’s omission from the matchday squad, amid media reports of a mooted transfer to Manchester United ahead of Monday’s deadline, with his replacement Bizot enduring a mixed match between the sticks.\nBizot had kept a clean sheet on his Premier League debut in Villa’s goalless draw against Newcastle United, but he was picking the ball out of the net midway through the first half after timing his challenge on Kamada inside the box all wrong.\nAnd at the other end, Villa lacked a real spark. Watkins twice tested Henderson in quick succession, though he saw both of his attempts at goal repelled by his England team-mate.\nVilla showed signs of improvement early in the second half as Youri Tielemans and Watkins came close, but their profligacy in the final third proved costly, with Emery’s team now the only side in the Premier League yet to score a goal this season.\nIt is back to the drawing board for the Villa boss as he aims to find the solutions during the upcoming international break in an attempt to try and spark his squad’s season into life, with a clash away to in-form Everton on September 13 up next.\nVilla were not the only team embroiled in transfer speculation before proceedings began at Villa Park, with Guehi linked with a move to Premier League champions Liverpool, but the England international featured from the off and was key in their impressive away-day display.\nHaving survived a wave of early Villa pressure, Palace found their groove and deservedly took the lead through Mateta’s penalty. They could have doubled their advantage soon after, too, but Sarr could only head Daniel Munoz’s cross over the bar on the stretch.\nAnd two goals in 10 second-half minutes from Guehi and Sarr put the result beyond doubt, with the former perhaps providing a fitting farewell to his four-year stint with the Eagles after putting in a captain’s performance.\nThere were also promising signs from Palace’s latest summer arrival Yeremy Pino, who embarked on a mazy run forward before sending Lerma on his way, but the Colombia international saw his late shot from a tight angle smothered by Bizot, though it mattered little in the end.\nAfter back-to-back draws in their first two games of the season, Palace have laid a solid foundation to build on heading into the break, with Glasner’s men welcoming newly promoted Sunderland to Selhurst Park.\nAston Villa report | Crystal Palace report"

That performance suggested they would be well-equipped to handle Bournemouth, whose high-tempo press can often mirror City’s.\nHowever, Frank’s hopes of becoming the first Spurs boss since Nuno Espirito Santo to win his opening three Premier League matches came to a shuddering halt as Bournemouth kept the hosts’ in-form attacking trio of Brennan Johnson, Richarlison and Mohammed Kudus quiet.\nFrank will be concerned about how easily the Cherries’ new-look backline contained his strike force, and how little Spurs created in attacking positions.\nWith James Maddison ruled out indefinitely, Spurs will be hoping new signing Xavi Simons can provide that much-needed creative spark, with the Netherlands international watching on from the stands following his move from RB Leipzig.\nHaving failed to beat Bournemouth last season, Spurs once again came unstuck, with Frank’s men unable to produce the same solutions that troubled City so effectively a week earlier.\nSpurs have two weeks to prepare for London derby with West Ham United, but before Monday’s transfer window deadline, Frank may want to see further reinforcements come in to provide additional attacking impetus.\nCherries stand firm after striking early again\nFollowing a midweek EFL Cup exit as they lost 2-0 at home to Brentford, the Cherries would have been eager to get back to winning ways and build some early-season momentum.\nThey scored in the fourth minute in their win over Wolves last week, and held on for a clean sheet and all three points, with their new-look defence showing their competency after shipping four at Anfield on the opening day, and it was a similar story here for Iraola.\nNot only did Bournemouth’s defence make short work of Spurs, neutralising Richarlison, Johnson, and Kudus, but they got in on the act offensively as Marcos Senesi assisted the game’s only goal.\nWith Bournemouth reportedly looking to further bolster their defensive ranks with the prospective acquisition of Alex Jimenez from AC Milan, Iraola will be aiming for his team to keep up their resiliency when they face Brighton & Hove Albion after the international break.\nSpurs report | Bournemouth report"

They will look to bounce back against Huddersfield Town in the EFL Cup on Tuesday, before hosting Brentford in their next top-flight outing.\nSunderland report"

        "report": "Sunderland's Premier League return got off to an ideal start with their 3-0 victory over West Ham United on Matchweek 1. However, the Black Cats have endured a slight reality check since, losing 2-0 at fellow promoted Burnley last Saturday before being beaten by Huddersfield Town on penalties in the EFL Cup.\nNevertheless, Le Bris’ team looked bright early on as they tried to assert their authority on proceedings, but were given a scare when Ouattara got in behind and tucked home – with the offside flag coming to their rescue.\nRoefs then produced heroics between the sticks to thwart Schade’s penalty, but he was powerless to deny Igor Thiago’s header in the 77th minute.\nSunderland had failed to convert each of their last four spot-kicks in the league, but Le Fee stopped the rot in the coolest of fashions.\nBut the hosts were not done there, with super sub Isidor arriving to head home a dramatic winner, sending them into the international break having opened a Premier League season with successive home victories for the first time since 2001.\nSunderland will be hoping to build on this win when they travel to Selhurst Park to face Crystal Palace on September 13.\nBees stung at the death\nBrentford had enjoyed a reverse in fortunes at the start of the season. Keith Andrews' side responded to losing their Premier League opener at Nottingham Forest with victory over Aston Villa, before overcoming AFC Bournemouth in the EFL Cup.\nThe Bees enjoy their travels, too, collecting 23 points on the road in 2025, with no Premier League registering more.\nThey thought they had broken the deadlock in the 21st minute. No Brentford player has ever scored in both his first two Premier League appearances for the club, and that record continues after Ouattara – the scorer of the only goal in last weekend’s victory over Villa – was denied.\nAlthough Schade was then foiled from 12 yards, the visitors continued to generate the stronger attacking threat, and were rewarded when Thiago turned in Onyeka’s cross.\nYet, it ultimately proved a false dawn. Henry’s sloppy challenge on Diarra presented Sunderland with the opportunity to equalise, which Le Fee duly took. Isidor then found a yard amidst tired defending to condemn the Bees to their second defeat of the season.\nAndrews will seek a positive response when his side welcome Chelsea on September 13.\nSunderland report | Brentford report"

Having been physically outmatched by Sunderland for two headed goals last Saturday, West Ham did not learn their lessons.\nThree of Chelsea's five goals came from corners, all of which were defended dismally. Wan-Bissaka failed to track Joao Pedro for the Blues’ leveller, while Hermansen was far too weak on the other two.\nJust one hour into West Ham's home campaign, many of their supporters were filtering out of London Stadium while the visiting Chelsea fans cheered their team's every touch.\nPotter needs to find a way to ensure West Ham's slow start does not become an alarming slide.\nThey visit Wolverhampton Wanderers in the EFL Cup on Tuesday before heading to Nottingham Forest for their next league fixture.\nWest Ham report | Chelsea report"

        "report": "Last Saturday, Wolves fell to defeat on the road against AFC Bournemouth, struggling to make any headway after the dismissal of captain Toti Gomes forced them to play much of the second half with 10 men.\nAnd though Vitor Pereira's side found the net twice here, their attacking shortcomings remain a concern.\nStriker Jorgen Strand Larsen watched from the stands at Molineux, with Pereira saying his omission was due to a minor injury. However, Newcastle United have reportedly been keen admirers of the Norway international.\nStrand Larsen turned Wolves' midweek Carabao Cup tie against West Ham United around with two goals from the bench in a 3-2 win, and on Saturday's evidence, Pereira cannot afford to lose him.\nThey will also be concerned by the sight of Hugo Bueno limping out of the action in the second half.\nPereira can at least take encouragement from the performances of substitutes Fer Lopez and Sasa Kalajdzic, both of whom made things difficult for Everton late on, but Wolves need to improve quickly. They go to St. James' Park to face Newcastle after the international break.\nGrealish propels Everton to victory\nAfter a memorable 2-0 win against Brighton last Sunday welcomed in a new era at Hill Dickinson Stadium, David Moyes will be delighted to see Everton maintain their momentum on the road.\nThe acquisition of Grealish continues to look an inspired decision. The former Aston Villa man was involved in all three of Everton's goals at Molineux, relishing the less-than-welcoming reception he got from the home fans.\nGrealish's two assists made him the first Everton player to ever record multiple assists in consecutive Premier League matches.\nDuring the first half, Everton were dominant in midfield, with James Garner and Idrissa Gueye controlling the tempo, while Dewsbury-Hall showcased his ability to ghost into the box on multiple occasions and gave Jose Sa no chance with his second-half strike.\nMoyes will be unhappy that Everton offered Wolves encouragement late on, but James Tarkowski and company stood firm at the back as the Toffees ground out the victory.\nFollowing the international break, Everton will host Aston Villa, with the opportunity to make it three straight Premier League victories.\nWolves report | Everton report"

        "report": "Marcus Tavernier scuffed his effort when Bournemouth created another chance against the run of play in the 35th minute, and it proved costly when they fell behind two minutes later.\nEkitike took Alexis Mac Allister's pass in his stride, and after the ball rebounded back to him off Marcos Senesi, the Frenchman applied a cool side-footed finish.\nHe turned provider as Liverpool doubled their lead in the 49th minute, with Ekitike offloading to Gakpo, who skipped inside from the left to find the bottom-right corner.\nBournemouth, however, refused to lie down and after Semenyo tucked in David Brooks' precise cross to half the deficit, Anfield was stunned into silence when he travelled from midway inside his own half before drilling home the equaliser.\nBut the Cherries could not quite hold on for a point as Chiesa – who had replaced Florian Wirtz just six minutes earlier – adjusted his body and fired in a superb finish following a goalmouth scramble.\nAnd Liverpool were not done there as Salah raced forward on the counter to collect Wataru Endo’s long ball and send a right-footed finish across Petrovic four minutes into added time, capping a magnificent contest on the opening night.\nLiverpool became renowned for playing \"heavy metal football\" under Slot's predecessor Jurgen Klopp, but the Dutchman instilled more control in 2024/25 as his side cruised to the title.\nHowever, with the Reds signing exciting quartet Ekitike, Wirtz, Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong ahead of a possible move for Alexander Isak, some believed more end-to-end encounters were in store at Anfield in 2025/26.\nThat was certainly the case here. Ekitike produced a statement performance up front, having announced himself to English fans with a fine goal against Crystal Palace in the Community Shield last week.\nEkitike's clever movement caused Bournemouth problems early on as he continually dropped deep to evade the visiting centre-backs. He did exactly that for his goal, turning in a midfield position before gliding into the box and finishing with confidence.\nBut after the forward combined with Gakpo for the second goal, Liverpool began to look fragile defensively. Ibrahima Konate got nowhere near Brooks in the build-up to Semenyo's first goal, then backed off the Ghanaian as he motored forward for the equaliser.\nHowever, the Reds showed the heart of champions to come back and win a game they had thrown away, even after Slot's surprising withdrawals of Frimpong, Kerkez, Ekitike and Wirtz.\nChiesa’s strike spared the hosts’ blushes, while Salah's clinching goal made him the first player in Premier League history to net 10 goals on opening weekends..\nWith Slot's new-look attack purring, they will approach their trip to Newcastle United on 25 August with confidence.\nBournemouth may not have left Anfield with any points, but Andoni Iraola – who expressed frustration with their lack of transfer activity earlier this week – had plenty of positives to take away.\nSemenyo's brilliant performance was chief among them, with the winger taking the fight to his former team-mate Kerkez at every opportunity.\nFor his second goal, the 25-year-old began his run inside his own box and still had the presence of mind to place a fine finish beyond Alisson when he reached the other area.\nHowever, Iraola will have been less impressed by Bournemouth's defensive performance, after they lost four of last season's back five in Kepa Arrizabalaga, Kerkez, Dean Huijsen and Illia Zabarnyi.\nSenesi came in at centre-back and made a nervy start, with Liverpool feeling he had denied Ekitike a clear goalscoring opportunity via a handball when the ball bounced off his thigh and on to his arm in the 14th minute.\nIt was ruled that the action was not a clear handball and that the incident took place too far from the goal to be worthy of a red card, but Senesi was also involved in Ekitike's opener as his weak challenge resulted in the ball bouncing back into the 23-year-old's path for a simple one-on-one finish.\nBournemouth are reportedly close to signing Ben Doak from Liverpool, with Cherries winger Dango Ouattara set to join Brentford, but defensive reinforcements may be Iraola's main focus ahead of hosting Wolverhampton Wanderers in eight days' time.\nLiverpool report | Bournemouth report\nArne Slot: \"We started the second half really well, being 2-0 up but we were playing against a team that never gives up.\n\"You have to give credit to them but they faced a team that is very fit as well.\"\nAndoni Iraola: \"It has been a very good game of football. They win the points but we did a lot of good things too.\n\"Even at 1-0 at half time I was really happy. At the end you can't concede four goals but even with at 2-2 it looked like we had energy, but Liverpool when they need it they find the extra energy.\"\nReferee: Anthony Taylor.

Trafford's ill-advised ball to Nico Gonzalez inside the City box was pounced on by Sarr, and subsequently punished by Palhinha's finish for Spurs’ second goal, and the former Burnley star looked nervy throughout.\nBernardo Silva and Jeremy Doku were introduced early in the second half – with Rodri and Phil Foden following later – but City never looked likely to find a way back into the contest, with Haaland often isolated. In fact, tame efforts from Rodri and Foden represented City’s only attempts on target after half-time.\nGuardiola will be demanding a response, and next up for Man City is a trip to Brighton & Hove Albion.\nMore Etihad success for Spurs\nFrank enjoyed a winning start to his Premier League reign at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, with Spurs sweeping promoted Burnley aside 3-0 last weekend.\nWhile this was always going to be a different test for Spurs, they had fond memories to draw on at the Etihad Stadium, where they were winners last season and had found the net at least twice in each of their four previous Premier League visits – a run that has now been extended to five trips.\nSpurs had Vicario to thank for coming out on top in his personal battle with Marmoush inside the opening 30 minutes, with the goalkeeper denying the winger from point-black range.\nFrank’s side then demonstrated their clinical edge at the other end, springing the offside trap to draw first blood, before an aggressive press in City’s area led to their second goal.\nA couple of last-ditch defensive interventions ensured City were kept at bay in the second half, and Frank will look to make it three wins from three when Spurs host AFC Bournemouth next weekend.\nClub reports\nMan City report | Spurs report"

Ballard has so often been Sunderland’s man for the big moments, and it was fitting that he then got on the scoresheet to send the Stadium of Light faithful into delirium. But perhaps just as important was the defender’s crucial block to deny Diouf in the first half.\nLast season’s top scorer Isidor then climbed off the bench to make his mark in the Premier League.\nDiarra, meanwhile, was lively on his debut, while Granit Xhaka brought plenty of experience – not to mention grit – in the middle of the match; exactly what he was brought in for.\nJenson Seelt was forced to make way early in the second half after a clash with Lucas Paqueta, but Le Bris will no doubt be delighted with how his team reacted to that loss as Sunderland now look ahead to facing fellow promoted team Burnley at Turf Moor.\nGraham Potter’s time at West Ham has been turbulent so far, but after a solid pre-season, he would have been looking for his side to make a statement that this campaign is going to be much better than the last.\nOn Saturday’s evidence, though, there is still an awful lot of work for Potter to do.\nPotter could point to his team having the better of the chances in the first half, and matters might have been different had Jarrod Bowen made the most of a pair of early opportunities, though both he and fellow attacker Niclas Fullkrug were kept quiet in the second half.\nCallum Wilson came on from the bench to cause some trouble late on, but the Hammers were caught short defensively for Sunderland’s first two goals, despite having plenty of numbers in the box.\nThey will need to significantly improve if they are to get a positive result when they host Chelsea in their next outing."

        "report": "Dominik Szoboszlai's sensational free-kick maintained Liverpool's winning start to the 2025/26 Premier League season, as they beat title rivals 1-0 at Anfield.\nLast season's top two were the only teams defending perfect records by Sunday, but it looked as though they would have to settle for a point apiece until the 83 minute, when Szoboszlai provided a moment of magic.\nArsenal were without Bukayo Saka due to a hamstring issue and started with captain Martin Odegaard on the bench, while they suffered a further blow when William Saliba was forced off injured early on.\nMikel Arteta's depleted side still looked set to escape with a point, but Szoboszlai whipped a spectacular dead-ball effort against David Raya's right-hand post and in.\nThe result ensures the champions will spend the international break top of the table as the only team on maximum points, with Arsenal in third.\nArsenal had to replace Saliba with Cristhian Mosquera after just five minutes, though the Gunners limited Liverpool to one wayward effort from Cody Gakpo in the early stages.\nNoni Madueke's volley forced Alisson Becker into a smart save, while Virgil van Dijk passed up a great chance to shoot at the other end in what was a quiet first half.\nLiverpool had the ball in the net around the hour via Hugo Ekitike, but the goal was disallowed as Gakpo was offside when he followed up on Raya's save from a Florian Wirtz strike, before the Frenchman prodded home.\nHowever, Szoboszlai sparked wild celebrations at the Kop end when, from over 30 yards out, he curled a vicious shot over the Arsenal wall and beyond Raya's dive.\nHaving been thrown on alongside Odegaard as a substitute, Arsenal debutant Eberechi Eze embarked on one threatening run into the area, but he failed to get a shot away under pressure from Joe Gomez as Liverpool held on.\nSunday's match had been billed as a clash between the irresistible force of Liverpool and the immovable object of Arsenal, with the result likely to offer some clues about the destination of the title.\nThe first half ended with groans of frustration from the home fans, as the likes of Mohamed Salah, Wirtz and Gakpo failed to get into the game.\nWirtz finally came to life when his left-footed strike was spilled by Raya, but Gakpo was clearly offside as he rushed onto the loose ball, causing Ekitike's close-range finish to be chalked off.\nLiverpool had already had to dig deep for dramatic victories over AFC Bournemouth and Newcastle United, with Federico Chiesa and Rio Ngumoha providing the late heroics in those matches.\nThis time, it was Szoboszlai – who enjoyed another excellent performance in an unfamiliar right-back role – that grabbed the headlines.\nLiverpool have arguably not displayed their best levels in any of their three matches this season, but they end August on maximum points and having scored in 37 successive Premier League games – a new club record.\nIt looks bright for Arne Slot ahead of a trip to Burnley on September 14. And Liverpool could look even stronger by then, with Marc Guehi and Alexander Isak still being linked with moves to Anfield, although Ibrahima Konate did go off injured.\nArteta has made Arsenal a tough nut to crack in the games that matter most – Arsenal did not lose a single Premier League match against a 'Big Six' rival last season, while they opened 2025/26 with a gritty 1-0 victory at Old Trafford.\nHowever, Arsenal have not won at either Anfield or the Etihad Stadium in the Premier League under Arteta, and there is a sense that he needs a statement result at the home of a title rival. His wait for such a victory goes on.\nThe early loss of Saliba could have knocked Arsenal's composure, particularly with Saka sidelined by a hamstring injury and Odegaard only fit enough for a place on the bench.\nBut substitute Mosquera did not look out of place at the back, while Madueke carried the fight to Liverpool throughout the first half.\nA string of corners also had the away fans out of their seats, but Declan Rice repeatedly failed to pick out a team-mate.\nAnd in the second half, it felt as though Arsenal were content to leave with a point, with Viktor Gyokeres isolated as the Gunners failed to record an attempt on target after the interval.\nSzoboszlai's moment of brilliance ensured Arsenal left empty-handed, and one wonders how important that strike will prove next May. After the international break, Arteta's side will look for a response at home to Nottingham Forest.\nLiverpool report | Arsenal report"

The 39-year-old requires just 15 more to surpass Gareth Barry’s record.\nHowever, the hosts could not hold out and saw two points slip away in dramatic fashion.\nNext Sunday they will be Everton’s first Premier League visitors at their new home at Hill Dickinson Stadium.\nFulham and Muniz dig deep\nFulham came into their fourth consecutive campaign in the Premier League fresh from registering their record points tally in 2024/25.\nSilva’s side appeared to be in with a chance of qualifying for Europe last season, but they slipped out of contention towards the end of the season.\nFulham have made just one signing during the ongoing transfer window – bringing in goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte as back-up to Leno – and large periods of Saturday's game highlighted their need to strengthen if they are to kick on again.\nHaving only started one of their last eight league campaigns with a victory, it was always going to be difficult for Fulham against a Brighton side that had only lost twice at home in 2025.\nThe visitors generally struggled to impose themselves on the contest and appeared set for a bleak start. They had only recorded one shot on target as the game ticked into stoppage time.\nBut that all changed in the 96th minute, when Muniz sparked joyous scenes among the away supporters, who will hope not to have seen him in a Fulham shirt for the final time. The Brazilian celebrated by grabbing a fan's scarf and holding it aloft.\nThe point gives Silva’s men something to build on ahead of welcoming Manchester United to Craven Cottage next Sunday – by which time he will hope some new faces have arrived.\nClub reports\nBrighton report | Fulham report"

        "report": "Villa had shown some promise between the interval and Konsa’s red card, though it was a largely underwhelming display from Unai Emery’s team, who did not have a single shot in the first half.\nComing away with a share of the points at least showed Villa’s resilience, while Newcastle may wonder what might have been had Isak been available.\nElanga could have got off to the ideal start in a Newcastle shirt when he raced through in the third minute, but Villa goalkeeper Marco Bizot – making his Premier League debut in the absence of the suspended Emiliano Martinez – made a fantastic save.\nGordon, filling in up top in place of Isak, headed over Harvey Barnes’ cross soon after, before the England international saw a deflected attempt palmed wide by Bizot.\nIn the second half, Boubacar Kamara headed straight at Nick Pope after being picked out brilliantly by John McGinn, yet Villa soon found themselves up against it.\nElanga threaded a superb ball in behind for Gordon to run on to – Konsa dragged the forward back and referee Craig Pawson showed the first red card of the 2025/26 Premier League season.\nMatty Cash made a superb block from a fierce Barnes volley, while Tino Livramento cushioned a volleyed cross just out of Gordon’s reach as Villa held firm.\nVilla won the corresponding fixture 4-1 last season, in what looked set to be a huge result in the race for Champions League qualification.\nBut it was not to be for Unai Emery's team, who missed out on a place at Europe’s top table on the final day of last season, and they have been unable to strengthen their squad as much as Emery would have liked over the off-season.\nAnd they looked sluggish from the off, sloppily turning over possession and offering little coming forward in the first half.\nThey came to life after the break; Kamara might have done better with his header from McGinn’s right-wing centre, while Ollie Watkins fired at Pope with his only real opening.\nJust as Villa were building up some pressure, though, it became a salvage job when Konsa got the wrong side of Gordon and reacted by hauling the attacker down.\nEmery will at least be pleased with the discipline and determination with which Villa defended from then on, while Bizot was in fine form when called upon, too. Substitute Donyell Malen offered some threat going the other way late on, but it would have very much been a smash-and-grab victory.\nHowever, Emery will want to see a much more well-rounded display from his team when they face Brentford next week.\nDespite the fact they have a UEFA Champions League campaign to look forward to, it has been something of a cruel summer for Newcastle.\nEddie Howe has had to answer plenty of questions over the future of star striker Isak, while he has seen reported targets slip through the club’s grasp, too.\nYet Newcastle demonstrated they still have plenty of quality even without Isak – their fluid front three of Barnes, Gordon and Elanga were extremely effective. However, the lack of an out-and-out striker was also evident.\nOn his competitive debut for Newcastle, Elanga could have broken the deadlock. That chance was followed up by a penalty appeal, as Barnes went down, but there was nothing doing for the officials.\nGordon, too, squandered a couple of chances, and it is not difficult to imagine these kinds of opportunities having been put away by Isak, if he had featured.\nJust what happens now with Isak remains to be seen, but in the meantime, Howe will hope for more incomings. Jacob Ramsey is reportedly set to join from Villa in the coming days, though his arrival will not resolve the striker situation.\nNewcastle’s first home game of the new campaign is against Liverpool on 25 August – an encounter that promises to be feisty.\nNewcastle have failed to win any of their last six Premier League games without Isak (D4 L2), failing to score in each of their last four, despite having 75 shots (9.4xG) across those six matches.\nVilla are unbeaten in their last 19 home matches in the Premier League (W11 D8), the Villans’ longest ever run on home soil in the competition.\nNewcastle are winless in their last four away Premier League games (D2 L2), their longest streak in the competition since a run of seven between October 2023-January 2024. They’ve also failed to score in four of their last eight away league games, as many occasions as in their previous 25.\nVilla failed to have a single shot in the first half of a Premier League game for the first time since March 2022 v Arsenal, ending a 123-game run of managing a shot in the opening half in the league.\nAston Villa report | Newcastle report"

        "report": "Liverpool then doubled their lead 20 seconds into the second half, with Ekitike stroking home via the left post.\nHowever, Newcastle halved the deficit when Guimaraes nodded Tino Livramento's cross home in the 57th minute, and after forcing Liverpool to defend a barrage of crosses, Eddie Howe's side drew level when Dan Burn's flick-on teed up Osula.\nHowever, 11 minutes of second-half stoppage time were signalled, and with 10 of those played, Dominik Szoboszlai dummied Mohamed Salah's cross for Ngumoha, who side-footed past Nick Pope to clinch a dramatic win.\nNgumoha, who turns 17 on Friday, earned rave reviews from Liverpool supporters as he scored two goals in pre-season.\nHis opportunities were expected to be limited after the Reds splashed out to acquire Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen, but Slot clearly trusts in his abilities, sending him on for Cody Gakpo when Liverpool were chasing a winner, even after the Dutchman had supplied two assists.\nNgumoha took advantage of tiring Newcastle legs to ghost into the area, and when Szoboszlai let the ball run through to the teenager, he gave Pope no chance with a pinpoint finish.\nHe is now the fourth-youngest goalscorer in the history of the Premier League, with only James Vaughan, James Milner and Wayne Rooney netting in it at a younger age. He's the second 16-year-old after Rooney to score a winning goal in the competition.\nWhile Ngumoha will steal the headlines, it was also a productive outing for Ekitike, who extended his scoring run to three matches in all competitions. The Frenchman's every touch was booed by the home supporters, but he coped admirably in a raucous atmosphere.\nAs was the case in their opening 4-2 win over AFC Bournemouth, Liverpool's defensive work left plenty to be desired, but even if a move for Isak does not materialise, they possess a fearsome level of firepower.\nWith title rivals Arsenal visiting Anfield on Sunday, Slot will hope for slightly less drama, with a similar result.\nSt James' Park is often electric under the floodlights, and that was certainly the case on Monday as Newcastle played their first game since Isak posted on social media about his relationship with the club.\nFurther spice was added by the presence of Ekitike, who was reportedly targeted by Newcastle before he opted for a move to Anfield. Despite links with Yoane Wissa and Jorgen Strand Larsen, among others, the Magpies are still yet to sign a striker.\nThey clearly suffered for their lack of a natural frontman in the first half, with Gordon missing two good chances after being deployed as a makeshift striker.\nAnd after Gordon saw red for scraping his studs down Van Dijk's calf with no realistic chance of winning possession, the hosts were always up against it.\nHowe will nevertheless be delighted by the way his side dragged themselves level, with Osula staking a claim for the No 9 role when he peeled off Ibrahima Konate to score Newcastle's leveller.\nBut clinging on through 11 minutes of stoppage time when down to 10 men was always likely to prove a tough ask, and Newcastle were left with nothing to show for their Herculean second-half efforts.\nThey will also be without the suspended Gordon when they visit Leeds United on Saturday, and the intervening days are unlikely to be quiet ahead of the transfer window closing on Monday.\nNewcastle report | Liverpool report\nEddie Howe: \"I think great performance from the players, both first and second half in very different ways., First half we thought we dominated the game. we were in a great place with just the goal missing. Second half we had a mountain to climb at 2-0 down with 10 men but I thought we controlled the game. I thought we were really good and fought our way back unbelievably well but couldn't get over the line to get a point.”\nArne Slot: \"It was a great goal for a 16-year-old. Rio [Ngumoha] can finish so well for his age. I did hear someway say afterwards in the dressing room he would have taken a first touch but he is so confident. For his age he is a really good finisher.\"\nReferee: Simon Hooper. Assistants: Adrian Holmes, Simon Long. Fourth official: Tony Harrington. VAR: John Brooks. Assistant VAR: Steve Meredith."

        "report": "Lukas Nmecha enjoyed a dream Leeds United debut as his late penalty handed them a 1-0 victory over Everton in their first game of the 2025/26 Premier League season.\nNmecha, who joined Daniel Farke's side on a free transfer in June after leaving Bundesliga club Wolfsburg, came off the bench to slot home from the spot in the 84th minute.\nHaving won the Championship title with 100 points last season, Leeds played with a swagger at a buoyant Elland Road, but it looked like they would have to settle for a point as a stubborn Everton defence dug in.\nHowever, the decisive moment came when James Tarkowski was penalised for handball from Anton Stach's deflected drive, and Nmecha held his nerve to beat Jordan Pickford.\nWhile Leeds are up and running, Everton will approach their first Premier League game at Hill Dickinson Stadium on Sunday without a point to their name.\nHow the match unfolded\nRoared on by a boisterous crowd, Leeds penned Everton back in the early stages and saw Pickford deny Joel Piroe a fifth-minute opener at his near post.\nWith Everton struggling to get out, Pascal Struijk completely missed his header after Pickford failed to get near a corner, while Daniel James saw a deflected volley spiral over the crossbar.\nGnonto sent a long-range drive over the top shortly before half-time, which arrived without Everton attempting a single shot.\nGnonto then rippled the side netting early in the second half, though Everton eventually improved as Lucas Perri denied Carlos Alcaraz before Jake O'Brien nodded over, while Manchester City loanee Jack Grealish came off the bench for his Toffees debut.\nHowever, it was Leeds that finished strongly, with Ao Tanaka volleying over before Stach's hopeful effort bounced up onto the left arm of Tarkowski.\nReferee Chris Kavanagh pointed to the spot, and after a brief VAR review confirmed the decision, Nmecha found the bottom-right corner, with Leeds holding firm through seven minutes of stoppage time.\nLeeds grind out statement win\nThe last time Leeds were promoted to the Premier League, under Marcelo Bielsa in 2020, they announced their ultra-attacking intentions on the opening matchday, losing 4-3 to Liverpool in an Anfield thriller.\nThis time around, it looked as though a lack of cutting edge may hold them back, as a dominant first-half performance went unrewarded.\nOf the eight players signed by Leeds in the transfer window thus far, seven are at least 6ft, and a flurry of early corners saw them lay siege to Pickford's penalty area. However, the towering duo of Tarkowski and Michael Keane were on hand to repel that pressure.\nFarke may have been wishing former Everton forward Dominic Calvert-Lewin – who arrived to Leeds on a free transfer on Friday but was not deemed ready for any involvement – was available as the game threatened to peter out into a goalless draw.\nHowever, another new striker proved to be the match-winner, with Nmecha staying calm to beat Pickford's dive and hand Leeds their first Premier League victory since April 2023.\nTougher challenges will await Leeds, starting with Saturday's trip to title hopefuls Arsenal, but Farke will be delighted with the way his team battled to a deserved three points.\nUneventful Everton display punished\nWith a shiny new home in the form of Hill Dickinson Stadium and marquee loan signing of England international Grealish, there were plenty of reasons for positivity at Everton ahead of the campaign.\nBut David Moyes has demanded more urgency in the transfer market, and in the first 45 minutes of their season, it was attack versus defence with Everton camped inside their own half.\nDespite Jarrad Branthwaite and Vitalii Mykolenko missing out due to injury, Everton were set up to withstand Leeds' physicality and defend their own area, with O'Brien and James Garner slotting into the full-back positions.\nHowever, Everton lacked an attacking outlet, even after gaining a foothold in the second half. Grealish came on for a cameo appearance in the 71st minute but was barely involved as a scrappy affair was decided by Tarkowski's handball and Nmecha's spot-kick.\nMoyes may have felt there was little Tarkowski could do as Stach's shot deflected onto his upper arm, but Everton could have few complaints about the result after registering just one shot on target.\nFar more will be expected of the Toffees when Brighton & Hove Albion visit Hill Dickinson Stadium on Sunday.\nClub reports\nLeeds report | Everton report"

        "report": "United were the better side early on and won a penalty when Kyle Walker was penalised for a foul on Mason Mount, but the decision was overturned as the challenge was deemed fair following a VAR review.\nThey eventually took a deserved lead in the 27th minute when Casemiro headed Fernandes’ free-kick off the crossbar, with the unknowing Cullen deflecting the rebound past Martin Dubravka. After Rodrigo Muniz’s own goal at Fulham, it made Man Utd the first team whose first two goals in a season have come via opposition players.\nBurnley equalised 10 minutes into the second half after Foster turned home Jacob Bruun Larsen’s cross.\nUnited regained the lead just 93 seconds later as Diogo Dalot’s low delivery was smashed in by Mbeumo, the first goal scored by a Man Utd player this season.\nHowever, the Clarets levelled again in the 66th minute when Anthony reacted quickest to Altay Bayindir’s parry in the box from a corner, his shot deflecting in off Kobbie Mainoo.\nSesko twice went close with headers after coming off the bench, before Anthony pulled Amad’s shirt as he was entering the box, and with the penalty given after a VAR review. Fernandes placed the ball into the bottom-left corner to snatch the win.\nSesko's late cameo shows promise\nThere were some eyebrows raised when Sesko was again on the bench from the start, and when Matheus Cunha was forced to leave the pitch after 31 minutes with a suspected hamstring injury, Amorim did not turn to the striker signed this summer from RB Leipzig.\nHe opted to bring on Joshua Zirkzee, leaving some United fans to wonder when their new striker will be ready for more than a cameo.\nThe Slovenian played the full 90 minutes in the defeat at Grimsby, but as usual in the Premier League, Amorim looked to his new wide players in Cunha and Mbeumo, who was brilliantly denied by Dubravka in the first half after a pacy counter-attack.\nAmad also could have added to United’s advantage in the first half, with a stunning volley tipped away by Dubravka. He then blazed over unchallenged from close range in a stunning breakaway, while Mount also hit the bar as United enjoyed a good spell.\nSesko eventually came on in the 72nd minute and showed signs of life in the final 10 minutes with two headers. The 22-year-old will be hoping to start his first match in the Premier League after the international break, when they travel to Manchester City.\nHero to zero for Anthony\nAnthony, who scored and assisted during Burnley’s win over Sunderland, will be disappointed to let his side down so late on in the game, especially after such a vital intervention earlier on.\nAlongside Foster, Anthony helped Burnley produce a strong performance in the second half at Old Trafford, with United unable to cope with their approach.\nThey created plenty of chances in their search third consecutive win in all competitions, following their midweek victory over Derby County in the EFL Cup, with Foster even seeing a goal disallowed after a narrow offside call.\nA potential worry for Parker, however, could come in the form of the experienced Walker at right-back, with many of United’s attacks coming down the left as they seemed to target his side of the defence.\nMbeumo’s goal came from down United’s left as Burnley struggled to deal with a lofted Bayindir pass and also found it difficult against United’s set-pieces in general.\nBurnley face another tough test in Liverpool after the break, but Parker has seen more than enough promise from his side to be confident in taking on the reigning champions.\nMan Utd report | Burnley report"

        "report": "Joachim Andersen and Alex Iwobi shot wide early on, either side of Chelsea – who were again without Cole Palmer – losing Liam Delap to a hamstring injury.\nKing slammed past Robert Sanchez after being freed by Sander Berge on a 21st-minute counter, though Muniz's tackle on Chalobah in the build-up was deemed a \"careless challenge\" by the referee.\nFulham did not heed the warning from former defender Tosin Adarabioyo, who headed over from point-blank range following a corner from Fernandez. The Argentinian landed another set-piece on the unmarked head of Joao Pedro to open the scoring.\nBernd Leno's trailing leg could not stop Fernandez's 56th-minute penalty after Jones reviewed the footage and concluded Sessegnon made \"his body unnaturally bigger\" by extending his arms to block Chalobah's delivery.\nJoao Pedro then cleared off the line in the dying stages after Andersen's header had deflected off Berge inside the six-yard area, with Chelsea's clean sheet remaining intact in a hard-fought victory.\nChelsea hardly missed Palmer in their thrashing of West Ham last time out, but an unchanged line-up without him lacked fluidity after a promising opening.\nJoao Pedro fired tamely at Leno, and Delap saw a fizzing effort blocked by Berge, though the hosts were far from convincing en route to snatching a first-half lead.\nDelap's disappointment was palpable after limping off in front of a Stamford Bridge crowd that included Alejandro Garnacho ahead of his reported transfer from Manchester United.\nEnzo Maresca may then have felt fortunate to fall on the right side of a VAR review in either half, especially having also seen Chelsea benefit from another overturned opener from Eberechi Eze’s free-kick for Crystal Palace in their opening match.\nEstevao and Reece James were both denied by Leno for a third goal, though Maresca may have just been pleased to see Chelsea grind out the win after a stuttering showing.\nDespite victory, the Chelsea boss will still want improvements when they visit Brentford after the international break, during which Palmer should recover from injury.\nLate goals against Brighton & Hove Albion and Man Utd snatched back-to-back draws, though Saturday's disappointment saw Fulham's unbeaten start halted.\nMarco Silva again set-up with full-back Timothy Castagne in an unusual right-wing position, leaving out-and-out attackers Adama Traore, Harry Wilson and Emile Smith Rowe on the bench.\nSilva's tactical call appeared to be a defensive decision, but Castagne almost set up Andersen, who should have done better from inside the area when aiming for the top-left corner.\nA fluid move almost brought 18-year-old King's first Fulham goal, though Berge's brilliance was undone by Muniz's apparent clumsiness in standing on a foot of Chalobah.\nThat overturned strike followed by slack marking from Fulham for Joao Pedro's header left Silva fuming on the touchline, either side of a last-ditch Moises Caicedo block denying Castagne a golden opportunity.\nSilva's fury in the dugout went up another notch after the penalty decision, while Fulham players seemingly claimed Joao Pedro had used his arm in the build-up to Sessegnon's handball.\nSilva's annoyance will hardly have been helped by Fulham's timid second-half performance, however, with his side needing to bounce back when they host Leeds United after the pause for international football.\nChelsea report | Fulham report"

        "report": "Nuno will seek a response when they travel to the Emirates Stadium to face Arsenal after the international break.\nThe pressure was already on West Ham and Potter after back-to-back Premier League defeats, and an EFL Cup exit at the hands of Wolverhampton Wanderers.\nTherefore, the Hammers would not have been relishing a trip to the City Ground, a stadium where they have notoriously struggled in the past, though that was not clear on Sunday.\nThe visitors carried a decent attacking threat for large periods of the contest. New signing Mateus Fernandes was put straight into the starting XI and added pace to his new side’s midfield.\nSummerville’s second-half introduction also proved an inspired substitution from Potter, as his pace culminated in an assist for Bowen just moments after entering the pitch, along with the awarding of the penalty that Paqueta tucked away.\nThe latter has been the subject of media reports linking him with a move to Aston Villa, but he demonstrated his passion to the travelling supporters by tapping the badge while celebrating.\nWest Ham were then sent into dreamland at the start of a lengthy stoppage time by Wilson, who then got in the way of Bowen adding a fourth after a mazy run through Forest’s defence.\nPotter now has some much-needed relief heading into the international break, and when they return, they have a home double header against Tottenham Hotspur and Crystal Palace to look forward to.\nForest report | West ham report"

Dowman, 54 days older than Nwaneri was on his debut, sits second on that list yet repeatedly troubled Leeds as a substitute.\nBoth teenagers are perhaps too green to be thrust into a huge encounter at Anfield next week, but even with injuries biting again, Arteta has options.\nLeeds their own worst enemy\nEvery promoted team must learn to adapt to the rigours of the Premier League, knowing when to attack games and when to look to dig in and grind out a result.\nAlthough it did not ultimately prove the most convincing win, Leeds certainly went on the offensive in their opener at home to Everton, keeping the visitors penned in during a frantic first half.\nWisely, Daniel Farke changed his out-of-possession approach for this game, initially setting his team up in a solid defensive shape that Arsenal largely struggled to break down in the first half.\nIn possession, however, there is work to do. Leeds continued to play out from the back and were repeatedly picked off.\nJayden Bogle earned an early booking when played into trouble by Lucas Perri, a first-half Gyokeres chance followed Stach being caught in possession, and then Arsenal’s second goal came after Ilia Gruev dallied and was robbed by Rice.\nLeeds will not be judged on games against the elite teams, but they need to quickly adjust to the pace of the top flight, with Newcastle United's high press unlikely to be any more accommodating in their next Premier League match.\nClub reports\nArsenal report | Leeds report"
