        "raw_text": "They twice came close on the counter, with Harry Wilson darting towards the edge of the penalty area and bending a shot narrowly wide, before Kevin saw a fierce low drive kept out by Sunderland goalkeeper Robin Roefs.\nKevin headed straight at Roefs from another opportunity soon afterwards while Josh King volleyed just off target later in the half, after Bertrand Traore's tame effort at the other end had been held by Bernd Leno.\nSunderland made a purposeful start to the second half, as Enzo Le Fee fired just wide just moments after kick-off.\nAt the other end, Ryan Sessegnon – on his 100th Premier League appearance – fizzed the ball into Wilson, who pulled a shot just the wrong side of the near post.\nSubstitute Emile Smith Rowe also fired just wide on the volley, but it was another player who came off the bench – Chukwueze – who delivered a wonderful in-swinging cross that was turned in by the outstretched leg of Jimenez.\nHome comforts proving crucial for Fulham\nThe late intervention from Jimenez provided Fulham with just the lift they needed after disappointing run of recent form.\nHowever, despite those struggles they have still been solid and consistent at Craven Cottage, with this win being their fourth triumph in their last five home league matches, and the only defeat in that run was a narrow loss against leaders Arsenal.\nFulham began the contest with plenty of intent. Wilson, fresh from scoring a memorable hat-trick for Wales against North Macedonia on Tuesday, and Kevin both looked lively and came close to breaking the deadlock during the first half.\nWilson was also a few inches away from opening the scoring after the break, but the game’s decisive goal came courtesy of only a second strike in the Premier League this season from Jimenez.\nIn the week Silva announced fellow striker Rodrigo Muniz will be out until the New Year with a hamstring injury, Mexico international Jimenez could not have picked a better moment to step up and deliver a crucial winner for Silva’s side.\nFulham have now claimed 13 of their 14 points this season at home. Given those exploits in front of their own fans, Silva may be slightly disappointed to be on the road against Tottenham Hotspur next Saturday.\nHowever, they will then welcome two members of the top four, Manchester City and Crystal Palace, to Craven Cottage in the first week of December.\nSunderland must regroup after late blow\nA positive result would have consolidated Sunderland’s position in the top four and, given the high standards they have set over recent weeks, this outing will have been disappointing for the travelling support.\nThe Black Cats, who were fresh from a stirring 2-2 draw with leaders Arsenal last time out, registered just two shots on target and lacked an attacking spark throughout the contest.\nThey were fortunate not to trail at half-time, but Le Bris’ words during the break appeared to be ringing in their ears when Le Fee drilled inches wide 10 seconds into the second half.\nThe visitors built on that momentum and started to look a little more positive going forward, but it did not take long for Fulham to recover control of proceedings, with Roefs regularly kept busy.\nSunderland came close to claiming what would have been a welcome away point, but were undone by Chukwueze’s delicious deep ball that was begging to be attacked, with Jimenez obliging to condemn the visitors to defeat.\nAfter suffering a first defeat in five league outings, Sunderland can still reflect on a magnificent first 12 matches back in the top flight and they will now regroup before looking to respond at home to AFC Bournemouth next Saturday, with the two teams locked together on 19 points.\nIt’s an exciting few weeks for Sunderland fans to look forward to, as that Bournemouth encounter comes before back-to-back away games against reigning champions Liverpool and Man City, with a home derby against fierce rivals Newcastle United to come after that.\nFulham report | Sunderland report"
